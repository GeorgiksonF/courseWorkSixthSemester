{"id":"2","title":"Biodegradable Nanocarriers Resembling Extracellular Vesicles Deliver Genetic Material with the Highest Efficiency to Various Cell Types","journal_id":"2","description":"Efficient delivery of genetic material to primary cells remains challenging. Here, efficient transfer of genetic material is presented using synthetic biodegradable nanocarriers, resembling extracellular vesicles in their biomechanical properties. This is based on two main technological achievements: generation of soft biodegradable polyelectrolyte capsules in nanosize and efficient application of the nanocapsules for co-transfer of different RNAs to tumor cell lines and primary cells, including hematopoietic progenitor cells and primary T cells. Near to 100% efficiency is reached using only 2.5 x 10(-4) pmol of siRNA, and 1 x 10(-3) nmol of mRNA per cell, which is several magnitude orders below the amounts reported for any of methods published so far. The data show that biodegradable nanocapsules represent a universal and highly efficient biomimetic platform for the transfer of genetic material with the utmost potential to revolutionize gene transfer technology in vitro and in vivo.","publication_date":"DEC","co-authors_number":"17","rating":"19.7"},
{"id":"3","title":"A procedure for calibration transfer of DOSY NMR measurements: An example of molecular weight of heparin preparations","journal_id":"3","description":"Calibration transfer is commonly used for spectra obtained on different spectrometers or other conditions. This paper reports a multivariate transfer approach for 2D diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) measurements among high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers on the basis of partial least squares (PLS) regression. As the test system previously published quantitative model to predict molecular weight of heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was used. For multivariate modeling, piecewise direct standardization (PDS) and direct standardization (DS) were employed. PDS showed the best performance for estimating heparin molecular weight resulting in a significant decrease in root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) from 647 and 393 Da without standardization to 513 and 135 Da when PDS was applied for heparin and LMWH, respectively. DS is not recommended for high-resolution NMR data. The study showed the success of standardization procedure in cases when multivariate models have to be applied to the 2D NMR spectra recorded on different NMR spectrometers. The proposed approach appears to be a valuable achievement towards application of transfer models also to 2D NMR data.","publication_date":"DEC","co-authors_number":"2","rating":"41.83"},
{"id":"4","title":"Chimera states in a ring of map-based neurons","journal_id":"4","description":"Chimera state is a simultaneous combination of synchronous and asynchronous environments in a network of identical oscillators, attracts the attention of researchers in the different fields of science. Neuroscientists believe that existing both the synchronous and asynchronous behavior in the brain plays a vital role in brain neuronal activity. As a result, in this paper, we investigate the ability of a neural network to produce chimera. Our focus has been on using a discrete neuronal model which resolve the curse of dimensionality by retraining the complex behavior at the same time. Each neuron is coupled to its neighboring with limited scope. The interdependency of the spatiotemporal dynamic on the coupling strength in a fixed range made the switching process visible, which rises with the appearance of thin bands of incoherence, occupying the whole space ultimately.

We address the problem of diagnosing the state of a system based on time series, when the latter includes data segments with distinct correlation properties, and show significant distinctions in the diagnostics of correlated and anti-correlated data sets. We demonstrate that anti-correlated dynamics are highly sensitive to switching between different states of the system, and the presence of several \"alien\" segments can provide a much stronger displacement of the scaling exponent unlike the case of correlated dynamics.

By the variation of the in-plane magnetization angle, we show that ferromagnetic resonance spectra essentially depend on the total height of the meander in the case of different magnetic field orientation with respect to meander segments. We demonstrate that the gradients of inhomogeneous static magnetic fields can lead to the effective generation of short-wavelength dipole-exchange waves having non-resonant spatial distribution. We show that the collective and localized spin-wave modes can be simultaneously excited in 3D magnonic crystals. We believe that obtained results will provide the basis for the development of 3D-elements for reconfigurable magnonic and spintronic devices with extended frequency tunability.","publication_date":"DEC 15","co-authors_number":"6","rating":"19.1"},

We demonstrated that the narrow-band laser emitting at 1265 nm could generate significant amount of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both HCT116 and CHO-K1 cell cultures. Such cellular ROS effects could be explained through the generation of highly localized plasmon-polaritons on the surface of mitochondrial crista. Our experimental conditions, the low-intensity irradiation, the narrow spectrum band (<4 nm) of the laser and comparably small size bio-structures (similar to 10 mu m) were shown to be sufficient for the plasmon-polariton generation and strong laser field confinement enabling the oxidative stress observed.","publication_date":"DEC 5","co-authors_number":"10","rating":"15.35"},

Two types of mosaic birefringent layers are considered: mosaic birefringent layers composed of identical non-chiral domains and statistically non-chiral layers composed of structurally similar (but generally not identical) domains. Analytical expressions for matrix operators that connect state vectors of the scattered and non-scattered components with the state vector of the incident beam are derived in terms of statistical structural characteristics of the layer. Based on the theoretical approach developed, some optical phenomena characteristic of mosaic birefringent layers, such as selective light scattering and inversion of circular polarization upon scattering, are explained. The effect of the degree of similarity of domains on the scattering properties of the layer is analyzed. Illustrative experimental examples are given.","publication_date":"DEC","co-authors_number":"4","rating":"20.81"},
{"id":"10","title":"Thickness of Polyelectrolyte Layers of Separately Confined Bacteria Alters Key Physiological Parameters on a Single Cell Level","journal_id":"10","description":"Confinement of bacterial cells in a matrix or in capsules is an integral part of many biotechnological applications. Here, the well-known layer-by-layer method of deposition of a polyelectrolyte film a few nanometers in thickness to confine separated bacterial cells in permeable and physically durable shells has been examined. Due to the physical properties of such a confinement, we found that this method enables investigation of effects of physical barriers against mass gain and cell division. Using the method of time-lapse confocal microscopy, we observed a prolonged lag phase, dependent on the number of polyelectrolyte layers. In the confinement, both the GFP fluorescent signal from the leaking T7 promoter and the cell size were increased by factors of more than five and two, respectively. This creates a paradigm shift that enables use of mechanical entrapment for control of bacterial cell physiology and opens possibilities of controlling the division rate as well as gene expression. These effects can be attributed to the perturbation of the sensing of the cell size, which results in disproportional synthesis of a cell envelope impinging the intracellular material and compels cells to grow rapidly. In addition, the charged surface of cells enables prolonged intercellular physical interaction and results in spherically shaped microcolonies.","publication_date":"DEC 4","co-authors_number":"4","rating":"39.09"},

We describe preparations for measurement and the actual measurements in considerable detail. We provide experimental response curves for the 2T937 transistor. A special test (measurement) board was developed to prevent the measured response curves from being affected in any way by the transistor mount or interface hardware (power buses, soldering leads, matching devices, adapters, etc.). A bare transistor chip was used to eliminate any effect of the transistor package on the results and improve the size and weight specifications of devices using the 2T937 transistor. The transistor chip can be directly mounted to a test board whose topology is used to connect the transistor chip to the device. The microstripline board is designed to enable measurements to be performed in the microwave frequency band using a probe station with standard calibration.","publication_date":"NOV","co-authors_number":"2","rating":"19.74"},

The cross-recurrence analysis is applied to the interbeat intervals and photopletysmographic signals from the mathematical model of cardiovascular system and from adults and newborn children. The model is examined under the conditions of the four experiments: with fully operational autonomic control, autonomic control weakened by 40%, autonomic control weakened by 70% and autonomic blockade. The coupling is most pronounced in adult subjects and the model with fully operational autonomic control, while it is absent under the autonomic blockade. Autonomic control is also not fully developed in newborn children. As the result, smaller coupling strength is expected. The results of cross-recurrence analysis of the model and experimental data are compared with the results of coupling detection based on the analysos of phase synchronization. Synchronization index demonstrates good correlation with the coupling strength in the model and weak coupling in newborn children in relation to adult subjects. In both cases, no correlation is observed between the synchronization index and the results of cross-recurrence analysis.","publication_date":"DEC","co-authors_number":"13","rating":"3.37"},

{"id":"18","title":"Framework of Evolutionary Algorithm for Investigation of Influential Nodes in Complex Networks","journal_id":"18","description":"There are many target methods that are efficient to tackle the robustness and immunization problem, in particular, to identify the most influential nodes in a certain complex network. Unfortunately, owing to the diversity of networks, none of them could be accounted as a universal approach that works well in a wide variety of networks. Hence, in this paper, from a percolation perspective, we connect the immunization and robustness problem with an evolutionary algorithm, i.e., a framework of an evolutionary algorithm for investigation of influential nodes in complex networks, in which we have developed procedures of selection, mutation, and initialization of population as well as maintaining the diversity of population. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we conduct intensive experiments on a large number of networks and compare it to several state-of-the-art strategies. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has significant advantages over others, especially on empirical networks in most of which our method has over 10 advantages of both optimal immunization threshold and average giant fraction, even against the most excellent existing strategies. Additionally, our discussion reveals that there might be better solutions with various initial methods.","publication_date":"DEC","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"120.16"},
{"id":"19","title":"Luminescent carbon nanoparticles separation and purification","journal_id":"19","description":"Nowadays luminescent carbon-based nanoparticles can be synthesized by a wide range of physical and chemical methods from a large variety of carbon-based sources. However, in most of the cases the product of synthesis is a complex mixture of compounds, which results in significant challenges in understanding the structure and optical properties of the reaction products. Consequently, a number of separation and purification methodologies have been developed to alleviate these challenges. In this review, we provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the art for methods of luminescent carbon nanopartides separation and purification. We specifically target such methods as sucrose density gradient centrifugation, chromatography techniques, and electrophoresis because of their ability for fine separation of the reaction products with into a number of fractions. The aim of our comparative analysis is to help development of future strategies for reaction product separation and purification leading to a better understanding of carbon nanoparticles structure and luminescent mechanism as well as to underpin their applications.

Due to their small size, chemical and optical stability and high luminescence quantum yield these particles can be further applicable in chemical and biomedical analysis, and in vivo imaging. The article gives a structured and detailed overview of the silanization strategies and potential pitfalls and common technical issues in function of the stability of the obtaining QDs. Different types of QDs, In- and Cd-based, were compared in terms of their behaviour during the silica-encapsulation. To achieve that each silica nanoparticle contains only one single QD the silanization reaction was performed via a water-in-oil emulsion formation. We investigated a number of parameters which have an impact on the silica-coating process and on characteristics of the obtained nanoparticles, such as a nature of initial ligands on the QD surface, a silanization reagent, surfactant, ZnS shelling, etc. It was found that DDT is an optimal ligand for the silanization of InP-based quantum dots, but not for CdZnSeS-nanocomposites. GOPTES and CEST are the best silanization agents for covering InP-QDs, and the AOT\/isooctane microemulsion is preferable for the silanization of CdZnSeS-composites.","publication_date":"DEC 1","co-authors_number":"5","rating":"35.58"},

Our ionic attoclock measurements are consistent with theoretical results from a numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and an upper bound of 10 as on the tunneling time from the attoclock readings in the H-2 molecule has been given, which is significantly smaller than any definitions of tunneling time available in the literatures.","publication_date":"NOV 26","co-authors_number":"9","rating":"34"},
{"id":"23","title":"Revival and death of oscillation under mean-field coupling: Interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic filtering","journal_id":"23","description":"Mean-field diffusive coupling was known to induce the phenomenon of quenching of oscillations even in identical systems, where the standard diffusive coupling (without mean-field) fails to do so [Phys. Rev. E 89, 052912 (2014)]. In particular, the mean-field diffusive coupling facilitates the transition from amplitude to oscillation death states and the onset of a nontrivial amplitude death state via a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation. In this paper, we show that an adaptive coupling using a low-pass filter in both the intrinsic and extrinsic variables in the coupling is capable of inducing the counterintuitive phenomenon of reviving of oscillations from the death states induced by the mean-field coupling. In particular, even a weak filtering of the extrinsic (intrinsic) variable in the mean-field coupling facilitates the onset of revival (quenching) of oscillations, whereas a strong filtering of the extrinsic (intrinsic) variable results in quenching (revival) of oscillations. Our results reveal that the degree of filtering plays a predominant role in determining the effect of filtering in the extrinsic or intrinsic variables, thereby engineering the dynamics as desired. We also extend the analysis to networks of mean-field coupled limit-cycle and chaotic oscillators along with the low-pass filters to illustrate the generic nature of our results. Finally, we demonstrate the observed dynamical transition experimentally to elucidate the robustness of our results despite the presence of inherent parameter fluctuations and noise.","publication_date":"NOV 22","co-authors_number":"6","rating":"16.82"},
{"id":"24","title":"The effect of hybrid coatings based on hydrogel, biopolymer and inorganic components on the corrosion behavior of titanium bone implants","journal_id":"24","description":"Modification of titanium (Ti) bone implant materials with hybrid organic-inorganic coatings is a novel promising approach to improve the osteoconductivity and osteointegration of implants and prevent their failure after implantation. However, in these coatings, which are mostly hydrophilic, chemically active moieties capable of releasing oxidizing ions can have a significant influence on the corrosion resistance of Ti, which is critical for the Ti implant osteointegration behavior. In this research, in order to study the dependence of the change of the corrosion behavior of Ti on the composition of the coating, Ti surfaces were modified with various coatings: organic (alginate hydrogel crosslinked with Ca2+ ions (Alg), and dextran sulfate (DS)), inorganic (porous calcium carbonate CaCO3), and composite organic-inorganic (Alg-CaCO3, DS-CaCO3). The morphology and composition of these materials before and after the corrosion experiment, performed in simulated body fluid (SBF), were followed by extensive characterization. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed to study the corrosion behavior of the prepared materials in SBF. The characteristics obtained during the EIS measurements revealed the dependence of the variation of the corrosion resistance level on the composition of the coating. The bare Ti surface had the higher value of the total impedance compared with the modified surfaces, while the Ti surfaces modified with organic coatings demonstrated the best charge transfer resistance in comparison with the coatings containing the inorganic CaCO3 component and uncoated Ti.","publication_date":"NOV 21","co-authors_number":"9","rating":"19.97"},

Commercially available long-period grating hollow core microstructured optical fibers (LPG HCMOF) were used to determine bovine serum albumin (BSA) and albumin from chicken eggs (OVA) in binary mixtures as well as immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the presence of BSA and OVA. LPG HCMOF transmission spectra allowed the detection of both BSA and OVA up to 10 mg\/mL with LOD as low as 0.1 and 0.8 mu g\/mL, respectively. Partial least squares regression (PLS) was utilized for modeling of LPG HCMOF spectral data and quantitative analysis of BSA, OVA, total protein, and IgG in binary and ternary mixtures. Rather high coefficients of determination (R-2) and low root mean square error for the calibration (RMSEC) (15%) and prediction (RMSEP) (20%) were obtained for all PLS models.

The rheokinetics of the sol-gel process is considered, the deformation and strength characteristics of the material were evaluated. The gelation time during plate formation has been established to decrease with increasing the template concentration and temperature. Chitosan d-ascorbate has been found to retard gelation. Stress-strain curves characteristic of soft elastic materials were recorded for our samples of silicon-containing glycerohydrogel plates. At rupture, the material shows some characteristic signs of macroscopic plasticity. The maximum achievable values of the physicomechanical parameters depend on the template\/precursor ratio. With an increase in this ratio, the tensile strength increases, whereas the concentration dependences of the relative elongation at break and Young's modulus show an extreme character. The plates based on chitosan D-ascorbate had higher mechanical strength and elasticity under uniaxial tension and a lower value of Young's modulus as compared to those based on chitosan l-ascorbate.

To achieve this performance a series of microstrip transmission lines with Iron (Fe) films of various thicknesses (from 100 to 800 nm) were designed, fabricated and tested. The basic principle of operation of these phase shifters are based on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). The influence of the thickness of the magnetic layer was studied for two frequency regions: below and above the ferromagnetic resonance. This is because for a real-device the insertion loss should be less than -3 dB (or as low as possible). In the high frequency region, the optimal frequency (corresponding to the highest change in phase shift) increased significantly with the increase of the Fe film thickness (from 27 GHz for the structure with 100 nm of Fe to 43 GHz for the structure with 800 nm of Fe film). In the low frequency region, however, the optimal frequency varied little with the Fe layer thickness. The highest change in phase shift (similar to 90 deg\/cm) corresponded to the structure with the thinnest Fe layer for the low frequency region and with the thickest Fe layer for the high frequency region. In the high frequency region the Figure-of-Merit was about 20 deg\/dB at low magnetic fields (< 1 kOe) and decreased with increasing field. The theory of operation for the proposed design is explained by using the full-wave High frequency structure simulator (HFSS) software.","publication_date":"NOV 1","co-authors_number":"5","rating":"22.92"},

We show that this relatively simple approach can deliver significant insights into the origins of photoluminescence. We found that products of the synthesis consist of both positively and negatively charged species and exhibit large dispersion in electrophoretic mobility (i.e. charge-to-size ratio). We observed that despite the large dispersion of the reaction products the blue light emission is confined to discrete bands clearly identifiable in the gel. We demonstrate clear evidence that this emission originates from the negatively charged light molecular fraction with the highest mobility which shows no excitation-dependent light emission. This molecular fluorophore exhibits spectral characteristics similar to previously reported 1,2,3,5-tetrahydro-5-oxo-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-7-carboxylic acid (IPCA). Secondary gel electrophoresis run performed on the bands extracted from the first run indicates that no further separation takes place. On the basis of our experimental results, we conclude that relatively stable binding exists between IPCA and EDA-derived product. Thus, the products of the reaction contain IPCA both in molecular form and in complexes with EDA-derived products. We conclude that excitation-dependent emission is related to the fluorophore binding to the positively charged EDA-derived products with a positive charge.","publication_date":"OCT 11","co-authors_number":"9","rating":"17.05"},

Adaptive networks have been successfully applied to study and understand phenomena ranging from epidemic spreading, infrastructure, swarm dynamics and opinion formation to the sustainable use of renewable resources. Here, we study critical transitions in contagion dynamics on multilayer adaptive networks with dynamic node states and present an application to the governance of sustainable resource use. We focus on a three-layer adaptive network model, where a polycentric governance network interacts with a social network of resource users which in turn interacts with an ecological network of renewable resources. We uncover that sustainability is favored for slow interaction timescales, large homophilic network adaptation rate (as long it is below the fragmentation threshold) and high taxation rates. Interestingly, we also observe a trade-off between an eco-dictatorship (reduced model with a single governance actor that always taxes unsustainable resource use) and the polycentric governance network of multiple actors. In the latter setup, sustainability is enhanced for low but hindered for high tax rates compared to the eco-dictatorship case. These results highlight mechanisms generating emergent critical transitions in contagion dynamics on multilayer adaptive networks and show how these can be understood and approximated analytically, relevant for understanding complex adaptive systems from various disciplines ranging from physics and epidemiology to sociology and global sustainability science. The paper also provides insights into potential critical intervention points for policy in the form of taxes in the governance of sustainable renewable resource use that can inform more process-detailed social-ecological modeling.","publication_date":"OCT","co-authors_number":"5","rating":"16.68"},

Functional connectivity between brain regions is achieved in terms of correlation or synchronization inference in recorded signals of neuronal activity. The promising approach for studying cortical network structure implies considering functional interactions in different frequency bands on the different layers of multilayer network model. Links between these layers can be restored based on cross-frequency couplings. While the topology of functional connectivity within each layer can be effectively restored from registered neurophysiological signals, mechanisms underlying coupling between different layers remain poorly understood. Here we consider evolution of the cortical network topology in alpha and beta frequency bands during visual stimuli processing. For each frequency band the functional connectivity between different brain regions is estimated by comparing Fourier spectra of EEG signals. The obtained functional topologies are considered as the layers of two-layer network. In the framework of a multilayer model we analyze evolution of functional network topology on both layers and reveal features of intralayer interaction underlying visual information processing in the brain.","publication_date":"OCT","co-authors_number":"5","rating":"16.68"},

The motivation of our study is neural networks in analog hardware; yet, the methodology provides insight into networks in general. Considering noisy linear nodes, we investigate the signal-to-noise ratio at the network's outputs, which determines the upper limit of computational precision. We consider additive and multiplicative noise, which can be purely local as well as correlated across populations of neurons. This covers the chief internal-perturbations of hardware networks, and noise amplitudes were obtained from a physically implemented neural network. Analytically derived descriptions agree exceptionally well with numerical data, enabling clear identification of the components critical for management and mitigation of noise. We find that analog neural networks are surprisingly robust, in particular, against noisy neurons. Their uncorrelated perturbations are almost fully suppressed, while correlated noise can accumulate. Our work identifies notoriously sensitive points while highlighting a surprising robustness of such computational systems.

{"id":"45","title":"Representation of a Polysemous Word in Models of Mental Lexicon","journal_id":"45","description":"The article reviews some of the most prominent theories of mental lexicon in regard to the problem of polysemy representation. The focus of the studies in the field of mental lexicon is on the search for an adequate way to represent, store and retrieve from the memory information about the senses of a polysemous word. The advantage of cognitive models of representation over \"listing\" senses in the lexicon is that they view a polysemous word as a multi-faceted structure of world knowledge rather than as a set of isolated senses. In this respect, a cognitive approach to polysemy proposes models of lexicon integrating dictionary and world knowledge. From the point of view of representation of such knowledge, the advantage of connectionist models of verbal memory is discussed, special emphasis is made on the associative verbal model. The existing studies of polysemy by the method of free associations have not investigated the semantic structure of a polysemous word as a cognitive phenomenon so far. The established method of analysis of responses to polysemous stimuli aims to differentiate the senses of the word in the associative field, since it is based on the assumption that distinction between \"senses\" and \"meanings\" is irrelevant for a language speaker. The relevance of the present study consists in the attempt to model polysemy of the word as a cognitive phenomenon. The author's aim is to propose a method of analysis of associations that allows to state the different status of homonymous lexemes and senses of a polysemous word in the lexicon. The results discussed in the article were obtained from the responses to polysemous and homonymous stimuli elicited from Russian-speaking students during a free association experiment. The analysis of the data involved semantic interpretation of the responses, their clustering and construction of the associative field. As a result, the structures of associative fields of polysemous and homonymous stimuli were compared. The method of analysis is aimed at the search for grounds on which senses of polysemous words are perceived as related by speakers of language. The comparison of the structures of polysemous and homonymous words revealed the peculiar features of both homonymy and polysemy. For instance, for the homonymous stimulus (\"ssylka\") it was found that associative responses are distinctly and more easily distributed into two groups referring to different meanings of the word (ssylkal \"link, reference\" and ssylka2 \"deportation\"), while the same differentiation is more difficult to accomplish when it comes to the senses of the same word (ssylkal as \"link\" or \"reference\"). The discovered difficulty is due to the responses which cannot be univocally attributed to a particular meaning (sense) of the word. These responses should be regarded as indicators of interrelatedness of the senses of the word, since they are more typical of polysemous stimuli rather than of homonymous. The analysis of the associative field of the polysemous word \"set' \" (\"net\") has also shown that the difficulty in attributing of association to one of the senses denotes the complex structure of senses typical of polysemy. Thus, the established feature of the associative field of a polysemous words presumably reflects their representation in the lexicon, different from homonyms.","publication_date":"OCT","co-authors_number":"1","rating":"35.04"},

Retrospective analyses suggest that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is one of the promising diagnostic targets because CSF passes through central nervous system, harvests tumor-related markers from brain tissue and, then, delivers them into peripheral parts of the human body where CSF can be sampled using minimally invasive and routine clinical procedure. However, limited sensitivity of the established clinical diagnostic cytology in vitro and MRI in vivo together with minimal therapeutic options do not provide patient care at early, potentially treatable, stages of LM, BM and BT. Novel technologies are in demand. This review outlines the advantages, limitations and clinical utility of emerging liquid biopsy in vitro and photoacoustic flow cytometry (PAFC) in vivo for assessment of CSF markers including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNA (miRNA), proteins, exosomes and emboli.

In this paper, we demonstrate that when studying the same dispersions of rGO and fluorescent Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria, the outcome of nanotoxicity experiments also depends on the type of culture medium. We show that rGO inhibits the growth of bacteria in a nutrition medium but shows little effect on the behavior of E. coli in a physiological saline solution. The observed effects of rGO on E. coli in different media could be at least partially rationalized through the adsorption of bacteria and nutrients on the dispersed rGO sheets, which is likely mediated via hydrogen bonding. We also found that the interaction between rGO and E. coli is medium-dependent, and in physiological saline solutions they form stable flocculate structures that were not observed in nutrition media. Furthermore, the aggregation of rGO and E. coli in saline media was observed regardless of whether the bacteria were alive or dead. Filtration of the aggregate suspensions led to nearly complete removal of bacteria from filtered liquids, which highlights the potential of rGO for the filtration and separation of biological contaminants, regardless of whether they include live or dead microorganisms.","publication_date":"OCT","co-authors_number":"11","rating":"13.85"},

Recent studies associate such fluctuations with dynamics of attention-related cortical networks, however the exact mechanism remains unclear. To address this issue, we consider functional neuronal interactions during the accomplishment of a reaction time (RT) task which requires sustained attention. The participants are subjected to a binary classification of a large number of presented ambiguous visual stimuli with different degrees of ambiguity. Generally, high ambiguity causes high RT and vice versa. However, we demonstrate that RT fluctuates even when the stimulus ambiguity remains unchanged. The analysis of neuronal activity reveals that the subject's behavioral response is preceded by the formation of a distributed functional network in the beta-frequency band. This network is characterized by high connectivity in the frontal cortex and supposed to subserve a decision-making process. We show that neither the network structure nor the duration of its formation depend on RT and stimulus ambiguity. In turn, RT is related to the moment of time when the beta-band functional network emerges. We hypothesize that RT is affected by the processes preceding the decision-making stage, e.g., encoding visual sensory information and extracting decision-relevant features from raw sensory information.","publication_date":"SEP 24","co-authors_number":"7","rating":"16.15"},

The patterns of charge transfer, electronic structure, and shift of the Fermi level during the filling of nanopores with potassium atoms are established. It is found that the greatest charge transfer from potassium atoms to the carbon framework is observed in PGR with a density of 1.1-1.4 g cm(-3) (that is, with a nanopore volume of 1300-1800 nm(3)) regardless of the framework topology. The maximum charge transfer occurs already when the mass fraction of potassium is 12 wt%. At the same potassium concentration, a maximum shift of the Fermi level to zero by similar to 3 eV occurs in a bilayer PGR film with a density of 1.4 g cm(-3). Thus, our work shows for the first time that the electronic properties of nanoporous materials doped with alkaline earth metals (in particular, potassium) can be controlled by varying the volume of doped nanopores, i.e. by controlling the density of the nanoporous material. We first demonstrated that the potassium doping of PGR would be more effective than potassium doping of GLC. It is established that 2D samples of PGR and GLC completely reproduce the electronic properties of the bulk samples and even surpass them in some parameters.

RESULTS: SCP of P. fuscus range from -1.7 to -2.7 degrees C. All individuals withstood exposure of 1 degrees C for 20 days; but freezing is lethal to animals: only one individual out of five withstood exposure of -1 degrees C for 3 days, and -2 degrees C is lethal to all animals. The condition of supercooling is unstable. CONCLUSION: The lower tolerable temperature is probably about 0 degrees C.

It has been shown that an irregular microwaveguide simultaneously supports both the propagation of magnetostatic spin waves with different (normal and anomalous) dispersion and competition between three- and four-wave spin-wave interactions. Generated multisoliton complexes consist of quasiperiodic sequences of two dark parametric pulses containing \"soliton trains\" consisting of three dark ultrashort four-wave envelope solitons. It has been found that quasiperiodic sequences of multisoliton complexes generated by the active ring resonator with a regular magnonic microwaveguide consist of one dark parametric pulse, which also contains three dark four-wave solitons. However, in contrast to the preceding case, four-wave solitons, having a longer duration, do not form soliton trains inside a dark parametric pulse.","publication_date":"SEP","co-authors_number":"2","rating":"36.2"},

{"id":"67","title":"COMPARISON OF SUFFICIENT DEGREE BASED CONDITIONS FOR HAMILTONIAN GRAPH","journal_id":"67","description":"A graph G is said to be Hamiltonian if it contains a spanning cycle, i.e. a cycle that passes through all of its vertices. The Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete, and many sufficient conditions have been found after the first sufficient condition proposed by Dirac in 1952. In this paper for all graphs with a number of vertices up to 12, the most popular sufficient degree based conditions for Hamiltonian graph are compared: theorems by Dirac, Ore, Posa, Chvatal and Bondy-Chvatal. The number of graphs which satisfy each condition is counted. With the number of vertices from 3 to 12, the number of graphs satisfying the Dirac condition is 1, 3, 3, 19, 29, 424, 1165, 108376, 868311, 495369040; the number of graphs satisfying the Ore condition is 1, 3, 5, 21, 68, 503, 4942, 128361, 5315783, 575886211; the number of graphs satisfying the Posha condition is 1, 3, 6, 31, 190, 2484, 53492, 2683649, 216082075, 40913881116; the number of graphs satisfying the Chvatal condition is 1, 3, 6, 34, 194, 2733, 54435, 2914167, 218674224, 43257613552 and the number of graphs satisfying the Bondy - Chvatal condition is 1, 3, 7, 45, 352, 5540, 157016, 8298805, 802944311, 141613919605. This result is the best one: about 90% of the Hamiltonian graphs satisfy condition proposed by Bondy and Chvatal in 1976. The FHCP Challenge Set is a collection of 1001 instances of the Hamiltonian Cycle Problem, ranging in size from 66 vertices up to 9528. All graphs from the FHCP Challenge Set were checked whether they satisfy considered conditions. It turned out that 11 graphs satisfy the Bondy - Chvatal condition: no. 59 (with 400 vertices), no. 72 (460), no. 79 (480), no. 84 (500), no. 90 (510), no. 96 (540), no. 128 (677), no. 134 (724), no. 150 (823), no. 162 (909), and no. 188 (with 1123 vertices).

{"id":"71","title":"Percept-related EEG classification using machine learning approach and features of functional brain connectivity","journal_id":"44","description":"Machine learning is a promising approach for electroencephalographic (EEG) trials classification. Its efficiency is largely determined by the feature extraction and selection techniques reducing the dimensionality of input data. Dimensionality reduction is usually implemented via the mathematical approaches (e.g., principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, etc.) regardless of the origin of analyzed data. We hypothesize that since EEG features are determined by certain neurophysiological processes, they should have distinctive characteristics in spatiotemporal domain. If so, it is possible to specify the set of EEG principal features based on the prior knowledge about underlying neurophysiological processes. To test this hypothesis, we consider the classification of EEG trials related to the perception of ambiguous visual stimuli. We observe that EEG features, underlying the different ambiguous stimuli interpretations, are defined by the network properties of neuronal activity. Having analyzed functional neural interactions, we specify the brain area in which neural network architecture exhibits differences for different classes of EEG trials. We optimize the feedforward multilayer perceptron and develop a strategy for the training set selection to maximize the classification accuracy, being 85% when all channels are used. The revealed localization of the percept-related features allows about 95% accuracy, when the number of channels is reduced up to 90%. Obtained results can be used for classification of EEG trials associated with more complex cognitive tasks. Taking into account that cognitive activity is subserved by a distributed functional cortical network, its topological properties have to be considered when selecting optimal features for EEG trial classification.","publication_date":"SEP","co-authors_number":"7","rating":"16.23"},

In the spectral region of 500-600 nm (hemoglobin absorption region), the temporal dynamics of skin reflectance indicates that the skin compression causes an exponential decrease in the amount of blood in it, with an average time of blood displacement from the compression area of approximately 4-5 min. After compression removal, the skin blood filling exponentially recovers approximately within 30 s. In the spectral region of 700-2000 nm, skin reflectance after compression monotonically decrease according to two-exponential law with characteristic times of approximately 10 s and several minutes, which may be determined by the displacement of free and bound water from the compression area.","publication_date":"SEP","co-authors_number":"2","rating":"27.5"},

The key step of the protocol is the pretreatment of urine before the detection to minimize background signal. The pretreatment includes extraction of intrinsic urine components using aluminum hydroxide gel (AHG) and further pH adjusting of the purified sample. The protocol was tested by detection of a single antibiotic in artificially spiked samples of real urine. Five antibiotics of cephalosporin class (cefazolin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and cefuroxime) were used for testing. SERS measurements were performed using a portable Raman spectrometer with 638 nm excitation wavelength and silver nanoparticles as SERS substrate. The calibration curves of four antibiotics (cefuroxime is the exception) cover the concentrations required for detection in patient's urine during therapy (25\/100-500 mu g\/mL). Random error of the analysis (RSD < 20%) and limits of quantification (20-90 mu g\/mL) for these antibiotics demonstrate the applicability of the protocol for reliable quantitative detection during therapeutic drug monitoring. The detection of cefuroxime using the protocol is not sensitive enough, allowing only for qualitative detection. Additionally, time stability and batch-to-batch reproducibility of AHG were studied and negative influence of the pretreatment protocol and its limitations were estimated and discussed.","publication_date":"SEP","co-authors_number":"2","rating":"157.8"},

Recognizing the type of movement, such as, e.g., imaginary movement (i.e., the movement that a person performs mentally) by right arm or left leg, is a more complicated task that often can only be solved in few channels. Nevertheless, such recognition was demonstrated for real movements using about 6-8 channels out of 32, and for mental intentions using 1-2 channels. To improve the recognition of various imaginary movements, preliminary training seems mandatory. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Earlier, we showed that exposure to these particles causes significant disturbances in the mitochondrial machinery and triggers PI-3-kinase mediated DNA damage responses. In the present study, we aimed to further understand the epigenomic insights of the ultrafine PM exposure. The higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and depleted Nrf-2 in ultrafine PM exposed cells reconfirmed its potential to induce oxidative stress. Importantly, the observed increase in the levels of NF-kappa beta and associated cytokines among exposed cells suggested the activation of NF-kappa beta mediated inflammatory loop which potentially serves as a platform for initiating epigenetic insinuations. This fact was strongly supported by the altered miRNA expression profile of the ultrafine PM exposed cells. These NF-kappa beta induced miRNA alterations were also found to be associated with other epigenetic targets as the exposed cells showed higher expression levels of DNA methyltransferases which positively corresponded with the global changes in DNA methylation levels. Upon further analysis, significant alterations in histone code were also reported in ultrafine PM exposed cells. Conclusively our results suggested that NF-kappa beta acts as an inflammatory switch that possesses the potential to induce genome-wide epigenetic modification upon ultrafine PM exposure.

We demonstrated the efficient ultrasound-induced release of labeled protein (Cy7-BSA) from elaborated nanocomposite microcapsules in vitro an in vivo. The capsule fabrication was done using combination of recently developed freezing-induced loading (FIL) technique and Layer-by-Layer assembly (LbL) used for the preparation of complex multilayer BSA\/tannic acid nano composite capsules sensitive to HIFU. These capsules contain NIR fluorescent Cy7-labeled BSA in the shell for tracking in vivo and the high concentration of labels inside the capsules resulted in self-quenching provides the real-time detection of the protein once it is released from the capsule. Ultrasound-induced release in vivo of Cy7-labeled BSA initially quenched by magnetite nanoparticles was confirmed by fluorescent tomography. The significant decrease of Cy7 fluorescence under HIFU treatment in vitro was found to be due to a generation of reactive oxygen species and fast dye oxidation.

Recent studies have shown that PDT can also open the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, there are no optimized parameters of PDT for patients at different ages. To determine whether there are age differences in PDT effects on the BBB, we studied PDT-related BBB opening through the optical clearing skull window in healthy 4- and 8-week-old mice. Methods In this work, we realized BBB opening by combining PDT with the optical clearing skull window by using different radiant exposures (635 nm, 10-20-30-40 J\/cm(2)) and 5-aminole-vulinic acid (5-ALA, 20 mg\/kg). Then, we evaluated BBB permeability by: (i) spectrofluorimetric measuring of Evans Blue dye (EBd) leakage; (ii) confocal imaging of 70 kDa FITC-dextran extravasation and the BBB integrity; and (iii) histological analysis of brain tissues. Results Using the skull optical clearing method, we demonstrated PDT-induced BBB opening to EBd and FITC-dextran in a radiant exposure manner. The histological analysis revealed the different severities of vasogenic edema corresponding to radiant exposures. Besides, the PDT-related increase in the BBB permeability to high weight molecules (EBd and FITC-dextran) and solutes (vasogenic edema) was more pronounced in 4-week-old mice than in 8-week-old mice. Conclusions The more pronounced PDT-induced BBB disruption in juvenile mice compared with adult mice suggests age differences in PDT-related BBB opening.

Nevertheless, the relatively weak fluorescence of PFPs limits their applications in biomedical imaging due to strong tissue autofluorecence background. Conversely, plasmonic nanolasers, also called spasers, have demonstrated potential to generate super-bright stimulated emissions even inside single cells. Nevertheless, the development of photoswitchable spasers that can shift their stimulated emission color in response to light is challenging. Here, we introduce the novel concept of spasers using a PFP layer as the active medium surrounding a plasmonic core. The proof of principle was demonstrated by synthesizing a multilayer nanostructure on the surface of a spherical gold core, with a non-absorbing thin polymer shell and the PFP Dendra2 dispersed in the matrix of a biodegradable polymer. We have demonstrated photoswitching of spontaneous and stimulated emission in these spasers below and above the spasing threshold, respectively, at different spectral ranges. The plasmonic core of the spasers serves also as a photothermal (and potentially photoacoustic) contrast agent, allowing for photothermal imaging of the spasers. These results suggest that multimodal photoswitchable spasers could extend the traditional applications of spasers and PFPs in laser spectroscopy, multicolor cytometry, and theranostics with the potential to track, identify, and kill abnormal cells in circulation.","publication_date":"AUG 27","co-authors_number":"7","rating":"21.93"},

However, the relationship of such fluctuations with the state of health is poorly understood. Purpose: The aim of our study was to assess the possibility of using spectral indices that reflect the intensity of oscillations of the photoplethysmographic waveform variability at frequencies 0.04-0.4 Hz as markers of hypertension and coronary artery disease. We did not study women to exclude the influence of menopause and sex hormones on the results. Materials and Methods: We compared synchronous 10-minute records of finger photoplethysmogram and respiration at rest in 30 healthy males (48.8 +\/- 4.5 years; data presented as Mean +\/- SD) versus 30 patients with hypertension (aged 49.0 +\/- 4.3 years) versus 30 patients with stable coronary artery disease (49.2 +\/- 4.8 years). Percentages of high-frequency and low-frequency ranges in the total power of photoplethysmographic waveform variability spectrum (HF% and LF%), and LF\/HF ratio were assessed. Results: HF% are subject to by 2- to 5-fold increase in hypertensive patients (p < .001) and up to an 8-fold increase in patients with coronary artery disease (p < .001) when compared with healthy persons. On the contrary, LF% is reduced by 1.5-5 times in all patients when compared with healthy people (p < .001). We identified cut-off points for each photoplethysmographic index to distinguish patients with coronary artery disease or hypertension from healthy subjects. Multiple logistic regression models based on photoplethysmographic waveform variability indices had sufficient sensitivity and specificity for patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease.

Among various methods and approaches to the synthesis, solid-state synthesis with a preliminary mechanochemical treatment of a mixture of starting materials was chosen as a variant of the compromising of simplicity and processability. In a series of experiments, different factors were sequentially varied in order to identify their influence on the properties of the final product. The article further presents the results of a systematic study of the electrochemical properties of LiFePO4-based material using a set of electrochemical methods: galvanostatic and potentiostatic intermittent titration and cyclic voltammetry. An original approach to graphical presentation of the potential-lithium ion concentration dependence in the LiFePO4 electrode was developed: for LixFePO4 solid solutions, the dependence was plotted against the lithium ion concentration; in the case of Li1 - xFePO4 solid solutions, against the lithium vacancies' concentration. This approach allowed correctly calculating and introducing the correction parameter z into the modified Randles-Sevcik equation, in order to determine the diffusion coefficient according to the cyclic voltammetry method. Analysis of the galvanostatic and potentiostatic intermittent titration transients was carried out in terms of the developed models that allow describing lithium transport in the diffusion layer with a permeable inner boundary (a mathematical model of heterogeneous system with two phases in equilibrium and an interphase boundary). A good agreement has been found between theoretically calculated and experimental current and potential transients. When varying the composition of the electrode with respect to lithium, kinetic parameters of lithium intercalation were determined: the lithium diffusion coefficient and the phase transition constant.","publication_date":"AUG","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"20.33"},

In particular, the presence of observational noise can produce the effect of spurious coupling (SC) that leads to the erroneous conclusion that there is mutual (bidirectional) coupling between two elements that are in fact coupled unidirectionally.

{"id":"92","title":"Quantifying the Numbers of Gold Nanoparticles in the Test Zone of Lateral Flow Immunoassay Strips","journal_id":"92","description":"Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is a rapid and simple point-of-care method for the detection of various analytes. In the colorimetric sandwich format, the reaction outcome is a colored test zone line formed by Au nanoparticle (AuNP) conjugates captured by bound analyte molecules. Although nanoparticle design is crucial for the assay sensitivity, the correlation between the test zone brightness and the number and size of captured AuNPs has not been studied in detail. To fill this gap, we used an unprecedented set of 10 spherical and monodisperse AuNPs with diameters d ranging from 16 to 115 nm. The calculated optical properties are in excellent agreement with two-layered Mie theory for Au cores coated with 3 nm CTAC shells with a refractive index of 1.5. Different concentrations of AuNPs (ICP-MS and UV-vis measurements) were spotted onto a nitrocellulose LFIA membrane, and the color intensity of the spots was measured and analyzed with RGB and HSV color parameters. The minimal detected spot intensity was proportional to the surface nanoparticle density and the particle volume. The derived size dependence means that extinction rather than scattering is the main physical mechanism behind spot brightness. The limit of detection (LOD) in terms of the surface nanoparticle density scaled like the inverse third power of the particle size (more precisely, like similar to d(-3.1)) and was about 7 x 10(7) and 1.5 x 10(5) particles\/mm(2) for 16 and 115 nm AuNPs, respectively. We analyzed an ideal LFIA format, when one analyte molecule delivers just one AuNP to the test zone. In this case, the theoretical LODs were in the pg\/mL range for a typical LFIA format with 0.1 mL of a 25 kDa analyte. In practice, these estimations could be increased by 2 orders of magnitude because of the larger ratio of analyte to captured AuNPs. This strongly reduced the assay sensitivity to the the ng\/mL level. Although an ideal LFIA predicts a strong increase in the assay sensitivity with the AuNP size (scales like similar to d(3.1)), this improvement could be compensated for in part by an increase in the number of ineffective analyte molecules bound to the AuNP surface (scales like similar to d(2)).","publication_date":"AUG","co-authors_number":"5","rating":"8.15"},

Exciton states are unstable for quantum dots without a shell and narrow-gap semiconductors, which leads to a substantial decrease in the probability of radiative recombination and, correspondingly, the quantum yield of luminescence. The experimental values of the spectral position of the luminescence maximum for quantum dots with clear manifestation of the exciton recombination mechanism noticeably shift to the long-wavelength region with respect to the calculated ones. In calculations and analysis, we use the effective electron mass for bulk semiconductors.

Despite the existing efforts to endow electronics with the capability of large deformation, the main technological challenge is still in the absence of suitable materials for the manufacturing of stretchable electronic circuits and devices with active (sensitive) and passive (stable) components. Here, we present a universal material, based on single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films deposited on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate, which can act as a material being both sensitive and insensitive to strain. The diverse performance of SWCNT\/PDMS structures was achieved by two simple dry-transfer fabrication approaches: SWCNT film deposition onto the as-prepared PDMS and on the prestretched PDMS surface. The correlation between applied strain, microstructural evolution, and electro-optical properties is discussed on the basis of both experimental and computational results. The SWCNT\/PDMS material with the mechanically tunable performance has a small relative resistance change from 0.05 to 0.07, while being stretched from 10 to 40% (stable electrode applications). A high sensitivity of 20.1 of the SWCNT\/PDMS structures at a 100% strain was achieved (strain sensing applications). Our SWCNT\/PDMS structures have superior transparency and conductivity compared to the ones reported previously, including the SWCNT\/PDMS structures, obtained by wet processes.","publication_date":"JUL 31","co-authors_number":"7","rating":"39.97"},

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been used to investigate the process of embryogenesis. However, the structural visibility of the embryo is decreased with the depth due to signal roll-off and high light scattering. To overcome these obstacles, in this study, combined is a spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) with gold nanorods (GNRs) for 2D\/3D imaging of live mouse embryos. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry is used to confirm that GNRs can be effectively delivered to the embryos during ex vivo culture. OCT signal, image contrast, and penetration depth are all enhanced on the embryos with GNRs. These results show that after GNR treatment, more accurate spatial localization and better contrasting of the borders among organs can be observed on E9.5 and E10.5 mouse embryos. Furthermore, the strong optical absorbance of GNRs results in much clearer 3D images of the embryos, which can be used for calculating the heart areas and volumes of E9.5 and E10.5 embryos. These findings provide a promising strategy for monitoring organ development and detecting congenital structural abnormalities in mice.","publication_date":"AUG","co-authors_number":"15","rating":"22.33"},

Specifically, we investigate changes of leg-muscle EMG amplitudes and EMG frequencies during walking, intentional stops, and unintended freezing-of-gait (FOG) episodes. FOG is a frequent paroxysmal gait disturbance occurring in many patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). We find that EMG amplitudes and frequencies do not change significantly during FOG episodes with respect to walking, while drastic changes occur during intentional stops. Phase synchronization between EMG signals is most pronounced during walking in controls and reduced in PD patients. By analyzing cross-correlations between changes in EMG patterns and brain-wave amplitudes (from EEGs), we find an increase in EEG-EMG coupling at the beginning of stop and FOG episodes. Our results may help to better understand the enigmatic pathophysiology of FOG, to differentiate between FOG events and other gait disturbances, and ultimately to improve diagnostic procedures for patients suffering from PD.","publication_date":"JUL 12","co-authors_number":"8","rating":"15.59"},

The low-pass filter part and the active part of LPAF exhibit different effects on the dynamics of these coupled oscillators. With the amplifying active part only, LPAF keeps the coupled oscillators staying in a nontrivial amplitude death (NTAD) and oscillation state. However, the additional filter is beneficial to induce a transition from a symmetrical oscillation death to an asymmetrical oscillation death and then to an asymmetrical oscillation state which is oscillating with different amplitudes for two oscillators. Asymmetrical oscillation state is coexisting with a synchronous oscillation state for properly presented parameters. With the attenuating active part only, LPAF keeps the coupled oscillators in rich oscillation quenching states such as amplitude death (AD), symmetrical oscillation death (OD), and NTAD. The additional filter tends to enlarge the AD domains but to shrink the symmetrical OD domains by increasing the areas of the coexistence of the oscillation state and the symmetrical OD state. The stronger filter effects enlarge the basin of the symmetrical OD state which is coexisting with the synchronous oscillation state. Moreover, the effects of the filter are general in globally coupled oscillators. Our results are important for understanding and controlling the multistability of coupled systems.","publication_date":"JUL","co-authors_number":"4","rating":"28.39"},

From the end of the Ryazanian, a gradual cooling episode began, which apparently continued throughout the Early Cretaceous except for a brief warming episode in the early Aptian. At the beginning of the Late Cretaceous, the climate became warmer; the peak of warming is recorded at the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary. Then, the middle-late Turonian was marked by a relatively cold episode. Later, in the Coniacian-Campanian, the climate warmed again, but at the end of the Campanian another cooling episode occurred. New findings of marine reptiles are described from the Toarcian, Kimmeridgian, Volgian, and Santonian-Campanian deposits of north of Eastern Siberia. All existing records of marine reptiles known from the Jurassic and Cretaceous of Siberia are revised, and all the findings (from 51 localities) are positioned in relation to paleolatitudes. It is established that the majority of occurrences of these fossils were within the polar paleolatitudes (70 degrees-87 degrees). We found no direct correlation between climate fluctuations and the distribution of these organisms. Taking into account the newest data showing that representatives of the majority of Jurassic and Cretaceous large groups of marines reptiles were able to maintain a more or less constant body temperature and were also able to undertake large-scale seasonal migrations, it is reasonable to be cautious in interpreting the presence of remains of these animals as indicators of a warm climate.","publication_date":"JUL","co-authors_number":"4","rating":"13.6"},

ST13 strain genovar E, which has a double deletion of 377 bp and 17 bp in orf1 gene of the cryptic plasmid (ddCT). This case occurred in an infertile patient (case-patient) with a detectable level of Chlamydial antibodies and a spermatozoa deficiency known as azoospermia. Additionally, the ddCT strain showed the presence of a duplication of 44 bp in the plasmid orf3 and SNP in orf4, which were known as the typical characteristics of the Swedish variant of C.t. (nvCT) genovar E. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) determined a significant difference between ddCT and nvCT in four alleles (oppA, hfiX, gitA and enoA). Both ddCT and nvCT were assigned to different genetic lineages and could be allocated to two different non-overlapping clonal complexes. Furthermore, ddCT demonstrated a considerable difference among 4-5 alleles in comparison with other C.t. strains of genovar E of ST4, ST8, ST12, and ST94, including the founder of a single relevant cluster, wtCT E\/SW3 (Swedish genetic lineage). In contrast to other genovar E strains, ddCT had identical alleles with seven out of seven loci found in ST13 strains of genovars D and G, including the founder for this clonal group, D\/UW-3\/CX, and six out of seven loci found in its derivatives, such as ST6, ST10, and ST95 of genovars G and H. Nevertheless, MSTree V2 showed that ddCT and nvCT could have a common early ancestor, which is a parental C.t. G\/9301 strain of ST9. A significant difference between ddCT and nvCT of genovar D (nvCT-D) that was recently found in Mexico was also determined as: (i) ddCT belonged to genovar E but not to genovar D; (ii) ddCT had a 44 bp duplication within the orf3 of the plasmid typical for nvCT; (iii) ddCT possessed an additional 17 bp deletion in the orf1. In conclusion, improved case management should include the clinical physician's awareness of the need to enhance molecular screening of asymptomatic Chlamydia patients.

By Mueller matrix polar decomposition, we can see that the major difference between polarization changes due to two kinds of agents is the opposite trend of phase retardance with clearing. For the insight of the connection between different agents with the niicrostructural and optical changes of cleared tissues, we establish various models to mimic the dynamic process of microphysical features of tissues with clearing time. The mechanisms considered include refractive index matching. collagen shrinkage, more orderly fibers and birefringence variation. We compare the experimental results with simulations based on a single mechanism model and a combined model, respectively, which confirms that an individual possible mechanism cannot explain the polarization phenomena due to clearing. Also by simulations of various clearing models involving two possible mechanisms, We can speculate that formamide and saturated sucrose as agents have respective impacts on tissue features and then cause different polarization changes With clearing. Specifically, collagen shrinkage plus birefringence reduction can better explain the tissue cleared by formamide, and refractive index match plus increased birefringence model is likely to be a proper description of tissue cleared by sucrose.

However, it provides bulk fluorescence signals from which the individual endogenous fluorophore contributions need to be disentangled. Skin optical clearing allows for increasing tissue transparency, thus providing access to more accurate in-depth information. The aim of the present contribution was to study the time changes in skin spatially resolved and multiply excited autofluorescence spectra during skin optical clearing. The latter spectra were acquired on an ex vivo human skin strip lying on a fluorescent gel substrate during 37 minutes of the optical clearing process of a topically applied sucrose-based solution. A Non Negative Matrix Factorization-based blind source separation approach was proposed to unmix skin tissue intrinsic fluorophore contributions and to analyze the time evolution of this mixing throughout the optical clearing process. This spectral unmixing exploited the multidimensionality of the acquired data, i.e., spectra resolved in five excitation wavelengths, four source-to-detector separations, and eight measurement times. Best fitting results between experimental and estimated spectra were obtained for optimal numbers of 3 and 4 sources. These estimated spectral sources exhibited common identifiable shapes of fluorescence emission spectra related to the fluorescent gel substrate and to known skin intrinsic fluorophores matching namely dermis collagen\/elastin and epidermis flavins. The time analysis of the fluorophore contributions allowed us to highlight how the clearing process towards the deepest skin layers impacts skin autofluorescence through time, namely with a strongest contribution to the bulk autofluorescence signal of dermis collagen (respectively epidermis flavins) fluorescence at shortest (respectively longest) excitation wavelengths and longest (respectively shortest) source-to-detector separations.

Their occurrence is dependent on the behavioral state, and they preferentially occur during unstable vigilance periods. The present study investigated whether the occurrence of SWDs can be predicted by the preceding behavioral state and whether this relationship is different between the light and the dark phases of the 24-h day. Twenty-four-hour (12:12 light\/dark phases) electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of 12 Wistar Albino Glaxo, originally bred in Rijswijk (WAG\/Rij) rats, a well-known genetic model of absence epilepsy, were analyzed and transformed into sequences of 2-s length intervals of the following 6 possible states: active wakefulness (AW), passive wakefulness (PW), deep slow-wave sleep (DSWS). light slow-wave sleep (LSWS), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and SWDs, given discrete series of categorical data. Probabilities of all transitions between states and Shannon entropy of transitions were calculated for the light and dark phases separately and statistically analyzed. Common differences between the light and the dark phases were found regarding the time spent in AW, LSWS, DSWS, and SWDs. The most probable transitions were that AW was preceded and followed by PW and vice versa regardless of the phase of the photoperiod. A similar relationship was found for light and deep slow-wave sleep. The most probable transitions to and from SWDs were AW and LSWS, respectively, with these transition likelihoods being consistent across both circadian phases. The second most probable transitions around SWDs appeared more variable between light and dark. During the light phase, SWDs occurred around PW and participated exclusively in sleep initiation: in the dark phase. SWDs were seen on both, ascending and descending steps towards and from sleep. Conditional Shannon entropy showed that AW and DSWS are the most predictable events, while the possible prediction horizon of SWDs is not larger than 4 s and despite the higher occurrence of SWDs in the dark phase, did not differ between phases. It can be concluded that although SWDs show a stable, strong circadian rhythm with a peak in number during the dark phase, their occurrence cannot be reliably predicted by the preceding behavioral state, except at a very short time base.

Plasmonic electron-hole ratchet based rectified current grows with decreasing the Fermi energy of charge carriers in the gated parts of graphene. It is shown that the charge carriers accumulated at boundaries of depleted parts of graphene enhance the magnitude and inhomogeneity of oscillating electric field of the plasmon, which leads to significant growth in the rectification efficiency. Interaction of plasmon modes in different gated parts of graphene can increase the rectification efficiency due to excitation of the hybrid plasmon modes.","publication_date":"JUL","co-authors_number":"4","rating":"20.01"},

The nanotube is a periodic structure made from C-60 fullerenes that are regularly polymerized with each other and with a nanotube wall with a step of several nanometers. A K+@C-60 complex, where K+ is a positive potassium ion, oscillates freely in the THz range in a potential well in the nanospace between polymerized fullerenes. Increasing the vibration amplitude of the K+@C-60 complex at the resonance frequency redistributes the electron density on the tube and creates a partial flow of charge to the fullerene frame of the complex, which changes the conductivity of the nanotube by several percent, depending on the applied voltage. This phenomenon can form the basis of a nanodevice for detecting THz radiation.","publication_date":"JUN 28","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"33.67"},

The reading of such an attoclock is readily obtained from a numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation as well as a semiclassical trajectory simulation. By comparing the two approaches, we highlight the essential physics behind the attoclock measurements. In addition, we analyze the predictions of the Keldysh-Rutherford model of the attoclock [A.W.

In molecular hydrogen, we highlight a strong dependence of the width of the attoclock angular peak on the molecular orientation and attribute it to the two-center electron interference. This effect is further exemplified in the weakly bound neon dimer.","publication_date":"JUN 27","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"39.53"},

We find that an increment in the local connectivity of the subnetworks enhances the span of the chimera region in parameter space. We consider the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi phase model to represent each node of the network and our numerical findings show that the topology of the subnetworks greatly influences the emergence of chimera states in the global ring. We also perform an analytical study on the phase oscillator based network using the OttAntonsen approach, and the analytical results are found to be consistent with the numerical outcomes. Furthermore, due to high relevance of the proposed network architecture to the human brain, we consider a more realistic network of Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model and reveal a similar phenomenon when the neurons in each of the subnetworks communicate via chemical synapses while information among the subnetworks passes through gap junctions.

Despite progress in cancer prognosis, the role of CTCs in early disease diagnosis is unclear because of the low sensitivity of CTC assays. We demonstrate the high sensitivity of the Cytophone technology using an in vivo photoacoustic flow cytometry platform with a high pulse rate laser and focused ultrasound transducers for label-free detection of melanin-bearing CTCs in patients with melanoma. The transcutaneous delivery of laser pulses via intact skin to a blood vessel results in the generation of acoustic waves from CTCs, which are amplified by vapor nanobubbles around intrinsic melanin nanoclusters. The time-resolved detection of acoustic waves using fast signal processing algorithms makes photoacoustic data tolerant to skin pigmentation and motion. No CTC-associated signals within established thresholds were identified in 19 healthy volunteers, but 27 of 28 patients with melanoma displayed signals consistent with single, clustered, and likely rolling CTCs. The detection limit ranged down to 1 CTC\/liter of blood, which is similar to 1000 times better than in preexisting assays. The Cytophone could detect individual CTCs at a concentration of >= 1 CTC\/ml in 20 s and could also identify clots and CTC-clot emboli. The in vivo results were verified with six ex vivo methods. These data suggest the potential of in vivo blood testing with the Cytophone for early melanoma screening, assessment of disease recurrence, and monitoring of the physical destruction of CTCs through real-time CTC counting.","publication_date":"JUN 12","co-authors_number":"13","rating":"29.17"},

{"id":"128","title":"On Adverbial Government","journal_id":"45","description":"The article deals with the issue of adverbial government. The linguistic literature related to the topic is briefly considered. Criteria of differentiation of adverbial and prepositional units formulated in modern research works are analyzed. Based on the analysis of the functioning of adverbs of manner in different spheres of communication, the author of the article personally compiled a dictionary, which includes about 6 000 units. The author allocated a small group of adverbs of manner (less than 1%) capable of adverbial government. Such adverbs, unlike prepositions, express qualitative characteristics of objects or phenomena and have more specific lexical meanings. The study does not take into account syntaxemes that are determining members of the sentence. The author notes that the ability of adverbs of manner to control the dependent form of the word is determined by the semantics of the adverb and by the grammatical properties of the words from which they derive. The positions of the actants can often be reflected in the dictionary definition of the adverbial lexeme. Synonymous adverbs usually govern the same prepositional case forms of nouns. Features of adverbial government are considered on the material of modern newspapers. An analysis of the material shows that most of these adverbial units characterize different actions, but some of them are used with verbs of being, state or quality. Adverbs that govern the dependent forms are used frequently and regularly in the titles of articles without forms of verbs they are grammatically dependent on. Under the influence of the communicative factors, the dependent form may precede the adverb. It is a consequence of active processes of modern syntax of the Russian language: the weakening of syntactic connections, the wide spread of parcelled constructions, the increased semantic capacity of statements. In headlines, journalists often use a language game based on the peculiarities of the meaning or sound of such language units. This is due to the desire of journalists to present the material as concise and at the same time expressive and original as possible. This tactic instantly draws the reader's attention to the material. Sometimes journalists ignore or violate grammar rules when they choose an adverb-dependent form of a word. Perhaps, this is due to the tendency to unify syntactic forms under the influence of semantic factors.","publication_date":"JUN","co-authors_number":"1","rating":"35.04"},

However, experimental evidence for their potential benefits in live human cells is scarce. Equally, practical applications often require substance delivery that is geometrically constrained and highly localized. Here, we establish human-cell biocompatibility and on-demand cargo release properties of the PEM or polylactic acid (PLA)-based microchamber arrays fabricated on a patterned film base. We grow human N2A cells (a neuroblastoma cell line widely used for studies of neurotoxicity) on the surface of the patterned microchamber arrays loaded with either a fluorescent indicator or the ubiquitous excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. The differentiating human N2A cells show no detrimental effects on viability when growing on either PEM@PLA or PLA-based arrays for up to ten days in vitro. Firstly, we use two-photon (2P) excitation with femtosecond laser pulses to open individual microchambers in a controlled way while monitoring release and diffusion of the fluorescent cargo (rhodamine or FITC fluorescent dye). Secondly, we document the increases in intracellular Ca2+ in local N2A cells in response to the laser-triggered glutamate release from individual microchambers. The functional cell response is site-specific and reproducible on demand and could be replicated by applying glutamate to the cells using a pressurised micropipette. Time-resolved fluorescence imaging confirms the physiological range of the glutamate-evoked intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in the differentiating N2A cells. Our data indicate that the nano-engineering design of the fabricated PEM or PLA-based patterned microchamber arrays could provide a biologically safe and efficient tool for targeted, geometrically constrained drug delivery.","publication_date":"JUN 1","co-authors_number":"6","rating":"31.8"},

These proteins play an important role in host-pathogen interaction and have been recognized as key virulence factors, highlighting the possibility of developing an omptin-based broad-spectrum vaccine. The prototypical omptin, His-tagged recombinant Pla, was used as a model target antigen. In total, 46 linear and 24 conformational epitopes for the omptin family were predicted by the use of ElliPro service. Among these we selected highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergenic, and immunogenic B-cell epitopes. Five epitopes (2, 6, 8, 10, and 11 corresponding to Pla regions 52-60, 146-150, 231-234, 286-295, and 306-311, respectively) could be the first choice for the development of the new generation of target-peptide-based vaccine against plague.

This is explained by the fact that the atom can initiate only a very sharp, fast-moving crowdion (anti-kink), which requires relatively high energy, while the molecule is able to initiate a less localized crowdion with considerably lower velocity and energy. In the current study, by means of molecular dynamics simulation, for the first time, this phenomenon is studied for a realistic 3D model of platinum crystal. We compare the efficiency of single Pt atom impact and Pt-2 molecule impact on the (101) surface of fcc Pt crystal for the initiation of mass transfer in the material by crowdions. It is revealed that in order to generate a crowdion moving inside the crystal, the properly oriented molecule needs an order of magnitude smaller energy than single atom. This considerable reduction of required energy happens when the molecule is oriented perpendicularly to the crystal surface and hits the crystal along a close-packed atomic row. Furthermore, it is revealed for the first time that the molecule with sufficiently large velocity can initiate the socalled supersonic 2-crowdion, which travels longer distances in the crystal than the classical supersonic crowdion having same or even higher energy. Our results can be useful for understanding and prediction the mass transfer during technological applications where bombardment by atomic clusters is employed to modify and improve mechanical or functional properties of surfaces.","publication_date":"JUN 1","co-authors_number":"6","rating":"18.73"},

Two typical algae toxins, microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and okadaic acid (OA), were chosen as proof-of concept targets to evaluate the feasibility of this ICA format. Commercial red- and green-colored FMs were selected to couple with monoclonal antibodies as fluorescent probes. The use of dual-wavelength FMs as labels guaranteed a lower consumption of material strips, lower sample volume, and shorter reaction time without increasing the length of ICA strips. Under optimal conditions, the multiplex FM-ICA could be completed in 20 min and reached limits of detection for the simultaneous determination of MC-LR and OA in fish samples, which were 0.074 and 2.42 mu g\/kg, respectively. The developed technique was validated using artificially spiked and naturally contaminated fish samples. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used as confirmatory technique. In summary, this portable ICAs detection mode based on dual-wavelength FMs provided a reliable and sensitive on-site detection of multiple contaminants in food samples, which opens a new field for application of FMs in food safety.","publication_date":"MAY 29","co-authors_number":"10","rating":"13.83"},

However, the design of an appropriate effective method for clinical use remains challenging. Here, we introduce calcium carbonate-based carriers for the transdermal transportation of bioactive substances. The proposed system presents easily manufacturable biodegradable particles with a large surface area enabling a high payload ability. Topical application of submicron porous CaCO3 particles in rats followed by the therapeutic ultrasound treatment results in their deep penetration through the skin along with plentiful filling of the hair follicles. Exploiting the loading capacity of the porous particles, we demonstrate efficient transportation of a fluorescent marker along the entire depth of the hair follicle down the bulb region. In vivo monitoring of the carrier degradation reveals the active dissolution\/recrystallization of CaCO3 particles, resulting in their total resorption within 12 days. The proposed particulate system serves as an intrafollicular depot for drug storage and prolonged in situ release over this period. The urinary excretion profile proves the systemic absorption of the fluorescent marker. Hence, the elaborated transdermal delivery system looks promising for medical applications. The drug delivery to different target regions of the hair follicle may contribute to regenerative medicine, immunomodulation, and treatment of various skin disorders. In the meantime, the systemic uptake of the transported drug opens an avenue for prospective delivery routes beyond the scope of dermatology.","publication_date":"MAY 15","co-authors_number":"10","rating":"27.98"},

It allows deeper understanding of pathological brain functioning and unraveling mechanisms underlying the epileptic seizure emergence along with its predictability. The latter is a desired goal in epileptology which might open the way for new therapies to control and prevent epileptic attacks. With this goal in mind, we applied the extreme event theory for studying statistical properties of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of WAG\/Rij rats with genetic predisposition to absence epilepsy. Our approach allowed us to reveal extreme events inherent in this pathological spiking activity, highly pronounced in a particular frequency range. The return interval analysis showed that the epileptic seizures exhibit a highly-structural behavior during the active phase of the spiking activity. Obtained results evidenced a possibility for early (up to 7 s) prediction of epileptic seizures based on consideration of EEG statistical properties.","publication_date":"MAY 10","co-authors_number":"10","rating":"15.35"},

By spatially averaging, the rough potential is equivalent to the combination of an effective smooth potential and an effective diffusion coefficient. Based on the Kramers theory, we first obtain Kramers approximations (KAs) of FPTD for both smooth and rough potentials. As expected, KA is valid only for high barriers and small external forces, and generally applicable for high barriers in rough potentials. To overcome the shortcoming of KA, a probability asymptotic approximation (PAA) based on an integral equation is proposed, which uses the transient probability density function (PDF) of the natural boundary conditions instead of the absorbing boundary conditions. We find that PAA fits very well even for large external forces. This enables us to analytically solve the FPTD for large external forces and low barriers as a strong extension to KA. In addition, we show that in the presence of a rough potential, the PAA of FPTD is in good agreement with numerical simulations for low barrier potentials. The PAA makes it possible to investigate the first-passage problem with ultrafast varying potentials and short exiting time. Thus, KA and PAA are complementary in determining the FPTD both for various barriers and external forces. Finally, the mean first-passage time (MFPT) is studied, which illustrates that the PAA of MFPT is effective almost in the whole range of external forces, while the KA of MFPT is valid only for small external forces.","publication_date":"MAY 3","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"33.65"},

Here, we report the emergence and existence of a novel type of nonstationary chimera pattern in a network of identically coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal oscillators in the presence of synaptic couplings. The development of brain function is mainly dependent on the interneuronal communications via bidirectional electrical gap junctions and unidirectional chemical synapses. In our study, we first consider a network of nonlocally coupled neurons where the interactions occur through chemical synapses. We uncover a new type of spatiotemporal pattern, which we call \"spike chimera\" induced by the desynchronized spikes of the coupled neurons with the coherent quiescent state. Thereafter, imperfect traveling chimera states emerge in a neuronal hypernetwork (which is characterized by the simultaneous presence of electrical and chemical synapses). Using suitable characterizations, such as local order parameter, strength of incoherence, and velocity profile, the existence of several dynamical states together with chimera states is identified in a wide range of parameter space. We also investigate the robustness of these nonstationary chimera states together with incoherent, coherent, and resting states with respect to initial conditions by using the basin stability measurement. Finally, we extend our study for the effect of firing regularity in the observed states. Interestingly, we find that the coherent motion of the neuronal network promotes the entire system to regular firing.","publication_date":"MAY","co-authors_number":"4","rating":"28.39"},

Our numerical studies indicate that when the coupling strength between the lattices is sufficiently weak, only a certain part of oscillators of the interacting networks is imperfectly synchronized, while the other part demonstrates a partially synchronous behavior. If the spatiotemporal patterns in the lattices do not include incoherent cores, imperfect synchronization is realized for most oscillators above a certain value of the coupling strength. In the regime of spiral wave chimeras, the imperfect synchronization of all oscillators cannot be achieved even for sufficiently large values of the coupling strength.","publication_date":"MAY","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"37.86"},

The ratio of the value of displacement of the sediment-supernatant boundary per time unit was taken as the blood sedimentation rate. In case of registration of different speeds of movement of this boundary in a given volume of the cuvette, their spatial averaging was performed. A substantial increase in the blood sedimentation rate was found experimentally at high levels of its dilution, and, conversely, at blood concentrations in physiologic saline solutions that are close to whole blood. At the same time, the rate of blood sedimentation decreased several times with blood content in the range of 30-50%. It was experimentally shown that variation of blood content in the physiologic saline solution over a wide range did not affect the evenness of sedimentation occurring for almost any blood concentration in the mixture. In other words, in the process of sedimentation of a single blood sample of a given dilution in the physiologic saline solution, the sedimentation rate does not change with time. The experimentally obtained results allowed to build a theoretical model of blood sedimentation for two cases: 1) sedimentation of free erythrocytes (highly diluted blood) and 2) sedimentation of erythrocyte aggregates (almost undiluted blood, up to whole blood). The originality of the model comes from the proposition to consider the sedimentation of cells and\/or their aggregates as a collective effect, and not in the traditional form of sedimentation of individual particles or particles interacting with each other. This model gives a satisfactory agreement with experimental laws with the use of certain empirical constants. The study is useful for understanding the process of erythrocyte sedimentation.","publication_date":"MAY","co-authors_number":"5","rating":"11"},

Stability of hollow microshells in saline, phosphate buffer and culturing media was studied.

The controlled synthesis of CdSe cores, with successive shells of CdS, CdZnS, ZnS and coating with transparent, stable, and inert silica shell, provides quantum dots with a narrow emission band, high quantum yield, and prolonged signal stability. Finally, the quantum dots were conjugated with specific antibodies via carboxylic groups on the silica surface. The method was further used for the immunochromatographic assay of C-reactive protein, a diagnostically important inflammatory biomarker. Assays with both the fluorescent QDs and a widely used colloidal gold label were developed in parallel and compared. The silanized quantum dots provide a more sensitive assay with a detection limit of 1 ng\/mL for C-reactive protein in standard solutions, whereas the common assay has a detection limit of 10 ng\/mL. The possibility of quantitative evaluation of analyte content by a portable device was demonstrated; the accuracy of the measurements was in the range of 5%-10%.

For the TD model, the Hopf bifurcation occurs when the primary pump exceeds the bifurcation value.

Environmental dynamics, i.e., changes in the state of an environment affecting the agents' payoffs has received less attention, lacking a universal method to obtain deterministic equations from established multistate reinforcement learning algorithms. In this work we present a methodological extension, separating the interaction from the adaptation timescale, to derive the deterministic limit of a general class of reinforcement learning algorithms, called temporal difference learning. This form of learning is equipped to function in more realistic multistate environments by using the estimated value of future environmental states to adapt the agent's behavior. We demonstrate the potential of our method with the three well-established learning algorithms Q learning, SARSA learning, and actor-critic learning.

The complementarity leads to a perfect synergy of properties of desired material and eventually an end-product. The diversity of resultant properties and materials used in the construction of hybrids, leads to a very broad range of application areas generated by engaging very different research communities. We provide here a general classification of hybrid materials, wherein organics-in-inorganics (inorganic materials modified by organic moieties) are distinguished from inorganics-in-organics (organic materials or matrices modified by inorganic constituents). In the former area, the surface functionalization of colloids is distinguished as a stand-alone sub-area. The latter area- functionalization of organic materials by inorganic additives-is the focus of the current review. Inorganic constituents, often in the form of small particles or structures, are made of minerals, clays, semiconductors, metals, carbons, and ceramics. They are shown to be incorporated into organic matrices, which can be distinguished as two classes: chemical and biological. Chemical organic matrices include coatings, vehicles and capsules assembled into: hydrogels, layer-by-layer assembly, polymer brushes, block co-polymers and other assemblies. Biological organic matrices encompass biomolecules (lipids, polysaccharides, proteins and enzymes, and nucleic acids) as well as higher level organisms: cells, bacteria, and microorganisms. In addition to providing details of the above classification and analysis of the composition of hybrids, we also highlight some antagonistic yin-&-yang properties of organic and inorganic materials, review applications and provide an outlook to emerging trends.","publication_date":"APR 4","co-authors_number":"7","rating":"25.29"},

Here, we report on the technique that allows magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hollow-core microstructured fibers (HC-MFs), which paves the way for combing MRI and optical bioimaging. Our approach is based on layer-by-layer assembly of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes and magnetite nanoparticles on the inner core surface of HC-MFs. Incorporation of magnetite nanoparticles into polyelectrolyte layers renders HC-MFs visible for MRI and induces the red-shift in their transmission spectra. Specifically, the transmission shifts up to 60 run have been revealed for the several-layers composite coating, along with the high-quality contrast of HC-MFs in MRI scans. Our results shed light on marrying fiber-based endoscopy with MRI to open novel possibilities for minimally invasive clinical diagnostics and surgical procedures in vivo.

Opening the BBB is very important for drug delivery to brain tissues to enhance the therapeutic effect on brain diseases. It is necessary to in vivo monitor the BBB permeability for assessing drug release with high resolution; however, an effective method is lacking. In this work, we developed a new method that combined spectral imaging with an optical clearing skull window to in vivo dynamically monitor BBB opening caused by 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)-mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT), in which the Evans blue dye (EBd) acted as an indicator of the BBB permeability. Using this method, we effectively monitored the cerebrovascular EBd leakage process. Moreover, the analysis of changes in the vascular and extravascular EBd concentrations demonstrated that the PDT-induced BBB opening exhibited spatiotemporal differences in the cortex. This spectral imaging method based on the optical clearing skull window provides a low-cost and simply operated tool for in vivo monitoring BBB opening process. This has a high potential for the visualization of drug delivery to the central nervous system. Thus, it is of tremendous significance in brain disease therapy.

Methods: Vero and HeLa cells were treated with the synthesized spirooxindoles, and the cytotoxicity was evaluated by using the AlamarBlue Cell Viability Reagent and live\/dead assay. Results: A series of poly-substituted pyrrolidines differing in nature and in substituent positions were obtained, with yields of 42-63%. Of the synthesized cycloadducts, 3-picolinoyl-4-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-phenylspiro[indoline-3,2'-pyrrolidine]-2'-one (4) was the most cytotoxic (IC50 < 20 mu g\/ml for both cell lines). Besides, 3-picolinoyl-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-5-phenylspiro[indoline-3,2'-pyrrolidine]-2'-one (1) was three times more toxic to the HeLa cancer cell line (IC50 = 70 mu g\/ml) than it was to the Vero healthy cell line. The cytotoxicity of compounds 1 and 4 was confirmed with a live\/dead assay. The cytotoxicity of a molecule was found to depend on the substitution nature on the benzene ring at the C-4 atom.

Many types of neurological and psychiatric disorders are accompanied or driven by alterations in the brain connectivity. In this study, putative changes in functional and effective corticocortical (CC), thalamocortical (TC), and corticothalamic (CT) connectivity during wakefulness and slow-wave sleep (SWS) in a model of thalamocortical dysrhythmia, TRIP8b(-\/-) mice, and in control (wild-type or WT) mice are described. Coherence and nonlinear Granger causality (GC) were calculated for twenty 10 s length epochs of SWS and active wakefulness (AW) of each animal. Coherence was reduced between 4 and ca 20 Hz in the cortex and between cortex and thalamus during SWS compared with AW in WT but not in TRIP8b(-\/-) mice. Moreover, TRIP8b(-\/-) mice showed lower CT coherence during AW compared with WT mice; these differences were no longer present during SWS. Unconditional GC analysis also showed sleep-related reductions in TC and CT couplings in WT mice, while TRIP8b(-\/-) mice showed diminished wake and enhanced sleep CC coupling and rather strong CT-directed coupling during wake and sleep, although smaller during sleep. Conditional GC coupling analysis confirmed the diminished CC and enhanced CT coupling in TRIP8b(-\/-) mice. Our findings indicate that altered properties of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels, characterizing TRIP8b(-\/-) mice, have clear effects on CC, TC, and CT networks. A more complete understanding of the function of the altered communication within these networks awaits detailed phenotyping of TRIP8b(-\/-) mice aimed at specifics of sensory and attentional processes.","publication_date":"APR 1","co-authors_number":"4","rating":"36.17"},

However, the development of robust methods for coating AuNRs with a biocompatible shell of high loading capacity and with functional groups still remains challenging. Here, we coated AuNRs with a polydopamine (PDA) shell and functionalized AuNR-PDA particles with folic acid and rhodamine 123 (R123) to fabricate AuNR-PDA-R123-folate nanocomposites. To the best of our knowledge, such AuNR-PDA-based composites combining fluorescent imaging and plasmonic phothothermal abilities have not been reported previously. The multifunctional nanoparticles were stable in cell buffer, nontoxic and suitable for targeted fluorescent imaging and photothermal therapy of cancer cells. We demonstrate the enhanced accumulation of folate-functionalized nanoparticles in folate-positive HeLa cells in contrast to the folate-negative HEK 293 cells using fluorescent microscopy. The replacement of folic acid with polyethylene glycol (PEG) leads to a decrease in nanoparticle uptake by both folate-positive and folate-negative cells. We performed NIR light-mediated targeted phototherapy using AuNR-PDA-R123-folate and obtained a remarkable cancer cell killing efficiency in vitro in comparison with only weak-efficient nontargeted PEGylated nanoparticles. Our work illustrates that AuNR-PDA could be a promising nanoplatform for multifunctional tumor theranostics in the future.","publication_date":"APR 1","co-authors_number":"4","rating":"25.82"},

We clarified the taxonomic position of Ochrobactrum cytisi strain IPA7.2 and investigated its tolerance for salinity, high temperature, and glyphosate pollution. We also tested the strain's potential to promote the growth of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) microplants. Using the IPA7.2 draft genome (no. NZ_MOEC00000000), we searched for housekeeping genes and also for the target genes encoding glyphosate tolerance and plant-growth-promoting ability. A multilocus sequence analysis of the gap, rpoB, dnaK, trpE, aroC, and recA housekeeping genes led us to identify isolate IPA7.2 as O. cytisi. The strain tolerated temperatures up to 50 degrees C and NaCl concentrations up to 3-4%, and it produced 8 mu gml(-1) of indole-3-acetic acid. It also tolerated 6mM glyphosate owing to the presence of type II 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase. Finally, it was able to colonize the roots and tissues of potato microplants, an ability preserved by several generations after subculturing. We identified the development phase of potato microplants that was optimal for inoculation with O. cytisi IPA7.2. Inoculation of in vitro-grown 15-day-old microplants increased the mitotic index of root meristem cells (by 50%), the length of shoots (by 34%), the number of leaves (by 7%), and the number of roots (by 16%). Under ex vitro conditions, the inoculated plants had a greater leaf area (by 77%) and greater shoot and root dry weight (by 84 and 61%, respectively) than did the control plants. We recommend O. cytisi IPA 7.2 for use in the growing of potato microplants to improve the production of elite seed material.

However, many studies are focused on the impact of anoxic conditions on benthic organisms, while coeval changes in pelagic cephalopod assemblages remain relatively poorly understood. In the present paper we discuss the trends in cephalopod assemblages coinciding with the onset of the early Aptian black shale deposition in European Russia coeval with OAE1 a. In few sections of the Saratov Volga area (central part of the Russian Platform), representing both offshore and more proximal nearshore lithofacies of the epicontinental Middle Russian Sea, we have recognized simultaneous changes in ammonite and belemnite successions. Belemnites, represented by the late members of the family Oxyteuthididae, are common in the interval directly preceding anoxic event, but totally disappear with the onset of the black shale deposition. For the Deshayesites ammonites shell size reduction across the mudstone black shale boundary (maximum shell diameter of adults reduces from-20 cm to 7-8 cm) can be observed. Some other ammonites become numerous (Sinzovia) within the black shale interval or show a first occurrence in it (Koeneniceras and Volgoceratoides). In our opinion diminishing of Deshayesites shell size during the early Aptian OAE could be caused by coupling of palaeoenvironmental factors such as progressive warming and regional input of brackish water. Preliminary results of carbon isotope studies of aragonite deriving from the ammonite nacreous layer are also provided.

Here, we demonstrate that by applying weak electric fields, regular, periodic and light-tunable patterns can be formed spontaneously in cholesteric liquid crystals. These patterns can be used as light-tunable diffraction gratings for which the period, the diffraction efficiency, and the in-plane orientation of grating vector can be controlled precisely, reversibly, and independently. Such a photoregulation allows generating a variety of one- and two-dimensional complex diffractive patterns in a single material. Our data are also supported by modeling and theoretical calculations.

A theoretical analysis shows that tracking either the external or internal signal in the coupling via a LPF gives rise to distinctly different ways of regulating the rhythmicity of the coupled systems. When the external signals of the coupling are attenuated by a LPF, the macroscopic oscillations of the coupled system are quenched due to the emergence of amplitude or oscillation death. If the internal signals of the coupling are further filtered by a LPF, amplitude and oscillation deaths are effectively revoked to restore dynamic behaviors. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated in laboratory experiments of coupled oscillatory electrochemical reactions by inducing coupling through LPFs.

{"id":"202","title":"Air pollution associated epigenetic modifications: Transgenerational inheritance and underlying molecular mechanisms","journal_id":"202","description":"Air pollution is one of the leading causes of deaths in Southeast Asian countries including India. Exposure to air pollutants affects vital cellular mechanisms and is intimately linkedwith the etiology of a number of chronic diseases. Earlier work from our laboratory has shown that airborne particulate matter disturbs the mitochondrial machinery and causes significant damage to the epigenome. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species possess the ability to trigger redox-sensitive signaling mechanisms and induce irreversible epigenomic changes. The electrophilic nature of reactive metabolites can directly result in deprotonation of cytosine at C-5 position or interfere with the DNA methyltransferases activity to cause alterations in DNA methylation. In addition, it also perturbs level of cellular metabolites critically involved in different epigenetic processes like acetylation and methylation of histone code and DNA hypo or hypermethylation. Interestingly, these modifications may persist through downstream generations and result in the transgenerational epigenomic inheritance. This phenomenon of subsequent transfer of epigenetic modifications is mainly associated with the germ cells and relies on the germline stability of the epigenetic states. Overall, the recent literature supports, and arguably strengthens, the contention that air pollution might contribute to transmission of epimutations from gametes to zygotes by involving mitochondrial DNA, parental allele imprinting, histone withholding and non-coding RNAs. However, larger prospective studies using innovative, integrated epigenome-wide metabolomic strategy are highly warranted to assess the air pollution induced transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and associated human health effects.

Under the action of a periodic change in dispersion, multisoliton pulses divide into several solitons moving at different group velocities. This effect can be used to prepare fixed sets of eigenvalues. A soliton signal can be recognized by analyzing pulses and their spectra at the exit from a fiber with a periodically changing dispersion.

From the correspondence of the functional dependence of the I-V characteristic to the theory, the emission mechanism is determined as direct tunneling through a depleted or enriched subsurface layer at the voltages V < 1 V and the tunneling emission from the surface electronic states at the voltages V > 1 V. Afield-emission threshold of (1-5) x 10(6) V\/cm is obtained, which is significantly lower than the values for metals and carbon. The determining factors of this emission mechanism are the Schottky effect, the localization and size quantization of light electrons in the surface area of III-V semiconductors, and the presence of a subsurface depletion layer in silicon. According to the data obtained for the values of the field-emission threshold, indium antimonide in the form of submicron grain particles is the most efficient field emitter.","publication_date":"MAR","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"17.69"},

The usage of different polymeric compounds as stabilizers can allow reducing of it and saving antibacterial activity. With this regard, the examination of new nanoparticles' stabilizers is a vital task. In addition, for the safe usage of silver nanoparticles it is necessary to estimate some of their physical properties and cytotoxicity. Here we evaluated the shape, size, UV-visible absorption, fluorescence, z-potential and cytotoxicity of single silver nanoparticles and nanoparticles, stabilized by polyvinyl alcohol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium oleate and agarose.

The photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) of gastric cancer using 5aminolevulinic acid\/protoporphyrin IX (5-ALA\/PpIX) has been reported in several studies. However, the selectivity of PDD of gastric tumor is poor with often false-positive results that require the development of new methods to improve PDD for early gastric cancer. Therefore, a measure of the complexity of gastric microcirculation (multi-scale entropy, MSE) and the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) were applied as additional tools to detect early gastric cancer in rats. In this experimental study, we used our original model of metastatic adenocarcinoma in the stomach of a rat. To induce a gastric tumor, we used a long-term combination (for 9 months, which is 1\/2 of the life of rats) of two natural factors, such as chronic stress (overpopulation being typical for modern cities) and the daily presence of nitrites in food and drinks, which are common ingredients added to processed meat and fish to help preserve food. Our results clearly show that both methods, namely, PDD using 5-ALA\/PpIX and complexity\/correlation analysis, can detect early gastric cancer, which was confirmed by histological analysis. Pre-cancerous areas in the stomach were detected as an intermediate fluorescent signal or MSE level between normal and malignant lesions of the stomach. However, in some cases, PDD with 5-ALA\/PpIX produced a false-positive fluorescence of exogenous fluorophores due to its accumulation in benign and inflammatory areas of the mucosa. This fact indicates that the PDD itself is not sufficient for the correct diagnosis of gastric cancer, and the use of additional characteristics, e.g., complexity measures or scaling exponents, can significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of PDD of gastric cancer that should be confirmed in further clinical studies and applications.","publication_date":"MAR","co-authors_number":"10","rating":"6.17"},

These properties make Miscanthus very attractive for industrial exploitation, such as lignin generation. In this paper, we present a systematic study analyzing the correlation of the lignin structure with the Miscanthus genotype and plant portion (stem versus leaf). Specifically, the ratio of the three monolignols and corresponding building blocks as well as the linkages formed between the units have been studied. The lignin amount has been determined for M. x giganteus (Gig17, Gig34, Gig35), M. nagara (NagG10), M. sinensis (Sin2), and M. robustus (Rob4) harvested at different time points (September, December, and April). The influence of the Miscanthus genotype and plant component (leaf vs. stem) has been studied to develop corresponding structure-property relationships (i.e., correlations in molecular weight, polydispersity, and decomposition temperature). Lignin isolation was performed using non-catalyzed organosolv pulping and the structure analysis includes compositional analysis, Fourier transform infradred (FTIR), ultraviolet\/visible (UV-Vis), hetero-nuclear single quantum correlation nuclear magnetic resonsnce (HSQC-NMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and pyrolysis gaschromatography\/mass spectrometry (GC\/MS). Structural differences were found for stem and leaf-derived lignins. Compared to beech wood lignins, Miscanthus lignins possess lower molecular weight and narrow polydispersities (<1.5 Miscanthus vs. >2.5 beech) corresponding to improved homogeneity. In addition to conventional univariate analysis of FTIR spectra, multivariate chemometrics revealed distinct differences for aromatic in-plane deformations of stem versus leaf-derived lignins. These results emphasize the potential of Miscanthus as a low-input resource and a Miscanthus-derived lignin as promising agricultural feedstock.","publication_date":"MAR 1","co-authors_number":"9","rating":"17.36"},

Besides, it is widely used in photooptics, optoelectronics, and protein chemistry, coordination chemistry of transition metals and lanthanides as well as in luminescent analysis. ET involves the transfer of electronic energy from a donor (D) (molecules or particles) which is initially excited, to an acceptor (A) at the ground state to emit it later. Fluorescence or phosphorescence of the acceptor that occurs during ET is known as sensitized. There do many kinds of ET exist but in all cases along with other factors the rate and efficiency of ET in common solvents depends to a large extent on the distance between the donor and the acceptor. This dependency greatly limits the efficiency of ET and, correspondingly, does not allow the determination of analytes in highly diluted (10(-9)-10(-15) M) solutions. To solve the problem of distance-effect, the effects of concentrating and bring close together the donor and acceptor in surfactant micelles (liquid nanosystems) or sorption on solid nanoparticles are used. Various approaches to promote the efficiency of ET for improvement determination selectivity and sensitivity using liquid and solid nanoobjects is reviewed and analyzed.","publication_date":"MAR","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"23.43"},

Traveling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers are the most promising candidates for such sources combining 10-100 W power and wide bandwidth. Here we present the results of design and simulation of a 0.2-THz TWT with a grating slow-wave structure (SWS) and electron-optical system (EOS) with a converging sheet electron beam. The designed EOS provides substantial improvement of the amplifier performance as compared with the EOS with straight beam immersed in a uniform magnetic field. In particular, it facilitates beam focusing and allows reduce of the focusing magnetic field and cathode current density. The latter allows increase of lifetime and makes possible operation in a continuous-wave mode. In addition, decrease of the beam thickness allows reduce of the beam tunnel height accordingly, which leads to nearly 2.5-times increase of the Pierce coupling impedance resulting in increase of gain and decrease of the required driving power. The simulation predicts small-signal gain over 30 dB in 180-200 GHz frequency band and over 80 W saturated power.","publication_date":"MAR","co-authors_number":"5","rating":"25.66"},

Two possible supercells of the SSCNT structure with minimal sizes of a \"window\" were obtained in the result of mathematical modeling. These supercells, called SSCNT-I and SSCNT-II, are distinguished by their topology and the number of non-hexagonal elements. On the basis of the analysis of stress-strain state curves, it was established that the structure SSCNT-I with a smaller number of defects was stronger. 2D films with experimental dimensions were obtained by translation of supercells SSCNT-I and SSCNT-II. The resistances of these films were calculated using the non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method: for SSCNT-I these values equaled 18.13 k Omega in the Z direction and 42.74 k Omega in the Y direction, for SSCNT-II - 65.86 k Omega in the Z direction and 60.17 k Omega in the Y direction. The better conductivity of the structure with supercells SSCNT-I along both directions can be explained by a less number of defects. Together with the better heat of formation and mechanical strength, it can be concluded that films composed of SSCNT-I are more suitable for application in electronic devices. Calculations show that the resistance of SSCNT films is higher than the resistance of CNT in 4 - 10 times, but they allow placing electrodes in both vertical and horizontal directions that may be important for their use in wearable electronics devices.","publication_date":"MAR","co-authors_number":"2","rating":"31.9"},

While it has been shown that tropical forests and savannahs are sustained within the same intermediate mean annual precipitation range, the mechanisms that lead to the resilience of these ecosystems are still not fully understood. In particular, the long-term impact of rainfall variability on resilience is as yet unclear. Here we present observational evidence that both tropical forest and savannah exposed to a higher rainfall variability-in particular on interannual scales-during their long-term past are overall more resilient against climatic disturbances. Based on precipitation and tree cover data in the Brazilian Amazon basin, we constructed potential landscapes that enable us to systematically measure the resilience of the different ecosystems. Additionally, we infer that shifts from forest to savannah due to decreasing precipitation in the future are more likely to occur in regions with a precursory lower rainfall variability. Long-term rainfall variability thus needs to be taken into account in resilience analyses and projections of vegetation response to climate change.","publication_date":"MAR","co-authors_number":"7","rating":"56.61"},

This approach is based on the quenching\/dequenching of emissions by the components in the sample and therefore has wider possibilities than the common fingerprinting technique, which is based on the intrinsic fluorescence of a sample. The procedure involved mixing the sample with fluorophores in 96-well plates and recording emissions by digital photography using a Camag Visualizer 2 instrument. After RGB splitting of the images, the data were normalized and treated by principal component analysis (PCA). The quality of discrimination, characterized by the number of separate groups of points in the scores plot, was essentially improved when the images were contrasted using the bundled software. To enable interactions with a wide range of potential marker compounds, we studied six fluorophores of different chemical origins (rhodamine B on silica nanoparticles, fluorescein attached to polyethyleneimine, a Schiff base obtained using o-phthalaldehyde and polyethyleneimine, quantum dots of CdSe\/CdS\/ZnS, a ruthenium(11) complex with 2,2'-bipyridine (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)), and a zinc complex with 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonate). Interestingly, just one fluorophore, Ru(bpy)32, sufficed to discriminate between 16 samples of whiskies (Scotch, Irish, Bourbon, and other varieties). The quality of discrimination by RGB images was at least equal to that obtained using the emission spectra measured with a spectrofluorimeter (400-700 nm).

Revealing atmospheric teleconnection patterns and understanding their underlying mechanisms is of great importance for weather forecasting in general and extreme-event prediction in particular(3,4), especially considering that the characteristics of extreme events have been suggested to change under ongoing anthropogenic climate change(5-8). Here we reveal the global coupling pattern of extreme-rainfall events by applying complex-network methodology to high-resolution satellite data and introducing a technique that corrects for multiple-comparison bias in functional networks. We find that the distance distribution of significant connections (P < 0.005) around the globe decays according to a power law up to distances of about 2,500 kilometres. For longer distances, the probability of significant connections is much higher than expected from the scaling of the power law. We attribute the shorter, power-law-distributed connections to regional weather systems. The longer, super-power-law-distributed connections form a global rainfall teleconnection pattern that is probably controlled by upper-level Rossby waves. We show that extreme-rainfall events in the monsoon systems of south-central Asia, east Asia and Africa are significantly synchronized. Moreover, we uncover concise links between south-central Asia and the European and North American extratropics, as well as the Southern Hemisphere extratropics. Analysis of the atmospheric conditions that lead to these teleconnections confirms Rossby waves as the physical mechanism underlying these global teleconnection patterns and emphasizes their crucial role in dynamical tropical-extratropical couplings. Our results provide insights into the function of Rossby waves in creating stable, global-scale dependencies of extreme-rainfall events, and into the potential predictability of associated natural hazards.","publication_date":"FEB 21","co-authors_number":"6","rating":"126.82"},

Theoretical investigations are conducted on the basis of the three-dimensional elastodynamic theory. The boundary value problem describing non-stationary wave motion is solved with the use of integral transforms and the modal expansion technique. The asymptotic analysis with the wavenumber considered as a small or large parameter is applied to the three-dimensional problem. In the first case (long-wave vibrations) the approximate formulae for the fundamental EW's pole and corresponding residue are derived. These relations take into account the influence of the transverse shear load arising because of coupling between long-wave integral and Saint-Venant's boundary layer. In the second case (shortwave vibrations) an infinite series of poles corresponding to higher order EW is revealed. Results of numerical investigations of EW dispersion properties and waveforms are presented and used for an analysis of experimental data acquired with the use of Laser Doppler vibrometry. It is shown that the contribution of EW is predominant in the wave-field excited by the load under consideration. A good agreement between theoretical predictions and measurements is demonstrated. For the calculation of transient wave-field three different models of actuator-plate interaction are developed: in the low-frequency range the interaction is considered as a static one, while the lower and higher eigenfrequencies of the actuator are taken into account in the medium- and high-frequency ranges respectively. For the low-frequency range, an explicit analytical formula is derived for calculation of EW contribution into the transient wave-field. In the high-frequency range, the excitation of the first higher order EW is predicted by the numerical solution and observed experimentally. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The results of this paper justify a potential of THz technology in the intraoperative label-free diagnosis of human brain gliomas for ensuring the grosstotal resection. (C) The Authors.

{"id":"241","title":"Nonlinear effect of biological feedback on brain attentional state","journal_id":"51","description":"A nonlinear effect of biological feedback on visual perception is studied when a brain-computer interface is applied. The implemented algorithm for estimation of visual attention is based on the time-frequency analysis of human electroencephalograms in real time by measuring the amplitude of the stimulus-related brain response, which takes subsequently positive and negative values. The analysis shows that time intervals with positive amplitude are associated with periods of sustained attention, whereas time intervals with negative amplitude are related to mental fatigue. The comparison of the results obtained in two groups of subjects, one without feedback and another with feedback, demonstrate that the feedback control prolongs the periods of sustained attention. The largest interval of sustained attention in the former group reached only 100 +\/- 20 s versus 150 +\/- 40 s in the latter group. However, the mean degree of attention, estimated by averaging the brain response amplitude over the whole interval, was 27% lower in the group with feedback than in another group. The obtained results evidence that cognitive resource is limited, and therefore, to maintain high performance for prolonged time, the brain has to work in a safe-mode regime.","publication_date":"FEB","co-authors_number":"6","rating":"30.14"},
{"id":"242","title":"Reconstruction of ensembles of nonlinear neurooscillators with sigmoid coupling function","journal_id":"51","description":"Inferring information about interactions between oscillatory systems from their time series is a highly debated problem. However, many approaches for solving this problem consider either linear systems or linear couplings. We propose a method for the reconstruction of ensembles of nonlinearly coupled neurooscillators described by first-order nonlinear differential equations. The method is based on the minimization of a special target function for each oscillator in the ensemble separately. To find the solution of optimization problem the nonlinear least-squares routine is used. The method does not exploit any parameterization for approximation of nonlinear functions of individual nodes. In addition, an original two-step algorithm for the removal of spurious couplings is proposed based on the clusterization of coefficients of the reconstructed coupling functions and the analysis of their variation. The method efficiency is shown for periodic and chaotic vector time series for ensembles of different size that contain from 8 to 32 oscillators. These oscillators have a cubic nonlinearity and sigmoid is considered as a coupling function. The effect of measurement noise on the results of coupling architecture reconstruction is studied in detail and the method is shown to be effective for relatively high noise (signal to noise ratio equal to eight).","publication_date":"FEB","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"60.29"},

The scheme has the second order of accuracy and incorporates the pressure Poisson equation. This equation is the integrability condition for the discrete momentum and continuity equations. Our algebraic approach to the construction of difference schemes suggested by the second and the third authors combines the finite volume method, numerical integration, and difference elimination. We make use of the techniques of the differential and difference Janet\/Grobner bases for performing related computations. To prove the strong consistency of the generated scheme, we use these bases to correlate the differential ideal generated by the polynomials in the Stokes equations with the difference ideal generated by the polynomials in the constructed difference scheme. As this takes place, our difference scheme is conservative and inherits permutation symmetry of the differential Stokes flow. For the obtained scheme, we compute the modified differential system and use it to analyze the scheme's accuracy.","publication_date":"FEB","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"22.04"},

Mono- and bilayer hybrid structures with CNTs (10,0) and (12,0) and an inter-tube distance of 10 and 12 hexagons were considered. It is revealed that elastic deformation is characteristic for mono- and bilayer composite films both in bending and stretching. It is found that, in the case of bending in a direction perpendicular to CNTs, the composite film takes the form of an arc, and, in the case of bending in a direction along CNTs, the composite film exhibits behavior that is characteristic of a beam subjected to bending deformation as a result of exposure to vertical force at its free end. It is shown that mono- and bilayer composite films are more resistant to axial stretching in the direction perpendicular to CNTs. The bilayer composite films with an inter-tube distance of 12 hexagons demonstrate the greatest resistance to stretching in a direction perpendicular to CNTs. It is established that the CNT diameter and the inter-tube distance significantly affect the strength limits of composite films under axial stretching in a direction along CNTs. The composite films with CNT (10,0) and an inter-tube distance of 12 hexagons exhibit the highest resistance to stretching in a direction along CNTs. The calculated distribution of local stresses of the atomic network of deformed mono- and bilayer composite films showed that the maximum stresses fall on atoms forming covalent bonds between graphene and CNT, regardless of the CNT diameter and inter-tube distance. The destruction of covalent bonds occurs at the stress of 1.8 GPa. It is revealed that the electrical resistance of mono- and bilayer composite films decreases with increasing bending. At the same time, the electrical resistance of a bilayer film is 1.5-2 times less than that of a monolayer film. The lowest electrical resistance is observed for composite films with a CNT (12,0) of metallic conductivity.","publication_date":"FEB","co-authors_number":"2","rating":"22.97"},

However, there remains a need for automated tools to assess instrument system suitability in real time for each particular routine sample. An automated procedure has been introduced to monitor a number of characteristics (resolution, symmetry, and half width) in real time after the measurement of two samples distributed by the vendor (0.3% CHCl3 in acetone-d(6) with tetramethylsilane and 2 mM sucrose in H2O-D2O). The results over 11 months were discussed in terms of average values, standard deviations, and spectrometer variability. Moreover, multivariate statistical procedure was implemented to evaluate metrics generated from three NMR spectrometers. Performance of three NMR spectrometers (500 MHz with BBO Prodigy Cryoprobe, 500 MHz with BBFOPLUS SmartProbe, and 600 MHz with BBO Cryoprobe) differed significantly. The developed routine was also applied to calculate the performance characteristics during routine quantitative NMR experiments. The procedure was evaluated for NMR spectra of 659 active pharmaceutical ingredients dissolved in CDCl3, DMSO, and CH3OD. This test is more preferable than the routine procedure using standard solutions because the performance is estimated separately for each matrix at the specific time point of measurements. Our automated routine is the ideal tool for any NMR laboratory. In full automation, the NMR data are validated directly for each sample, making unnecessary daily measurements of standard solutions and manual evaluation to their NMR spectra.","publication_date":"FEB-MAR","co-authors_number":"2","rating":"43.37"},

However, conventional LFIA strips have several disadvantages, including limits in quantitative analysis and low sensitivity. Here we developed a novel surface-enhanced Raman scattering LFIA based on nonspherical gap-enhanced Raman tags (GERTs), with Raman molecules (RMs) embedded in a 1-nm gap between Au nanorod core and Au shell. Such tags have a strong and uniform SERS response, an order of magnitude higher than that of other common SERS tags such as Au nanorods, nanostars, Au nanoshells with surface-adsorbed RMs, or spherical GERTs with embedded RMs. The feasibility of the tags was demonstrated by the semiquantitative and sensitive detection of the heart disease biomarker cardiac troponin I (cTnI). GERTs were conjugated with monoclonal antibodies and used for LFIA in the same way as ordinary functionalized colloidal gold. The presence of the target antigen, cTnI, was identified by Raman microscopy mapping of the test zone. With the SERS-based LFIA, the limit of cTnI detection was about 0.1 ng\/mL. This value is within the diagnostic range of cTnI in the blood serum of patients with heart infarction and is 30 times lower than that of the colorimetric LFIA test using the same antibodies and either GERTs or colloidal gold as labels.","publication_date":"FEB","co-authors_number":"5","rating":"54.27"},

{"id":"253","title":"Complex network approaches to nonlinear time series analysis","journal_id":"253","description":"In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems. The overall aim of this report is to provide the readers with the knowledge how the complex network approaches can be applied to their own field of real-world time series analysis.

{"id":"256","title":"Emergence of synchronization in multiplex networks of mobile Rossler oscillators","journal_id":"23","description":"Different aspects of synchronization emerging in networks of coupled oscillators have been examined prominently in the last decades. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid on the emergence of this imperative collective phenomenon in networks displaying temporal changes in the connectivity patterns. However, there are numerous practical examples where interactions are present only at certain points of time owing to physical proximity. In this work, we concentrate on exploring the emergence of interlayer and intralayer synchronization states in a multiplex dynamical network comprising of layers having mobile nodes performing two-dimensional lattice random walk. We thoroughly illustrate the impacts of the network parameters, in particular, the vision range phi and the step size u together with the inter- and intralayer coupling strengths epsilon and k on these synchronous states arising in coupled Rossler systems. The presented numerical results are very well validated by analytically derived necessary conditions for the emergence and stability of the synchronous states. Furthermore, the robustness of the states of synchrony is studied under both structural and dynamical perturbations. We find interesting results on interlayer synchronization for a continuous removal of the interlayer links as well as for progressively created static nodes. We demonstrate that the mobility parameters responsible for intralayer movement of the nodes can retrieve interlayer synchrony under such structural perturbations. For further analysis of survivability of interlayer synchrony against dynamical perturbations, we proceed through the investigation of single-node basin stability, where again the intralayer mobility properties have noticeable impacts. We also discuss the scenarios related mainly to effects of the mobility parameters in cases of varying lattice size and percolation of the whole network.","publication_date":"JAN 4","co-authors_number":"3","rating":"33.65"},

Both OCT and TPS studies were done just after the tissue resection and included gelatin embedding of the samples for conservation of water content. The further histological examination using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained microscopy approved the diagnosis. The results demonstrate the potential of TPS to differentiate intact and malignant tissues and the potential of OCT to differentiate low- and high-grade gliomas as well as intact tissue and low-grade gliomas.

As the basis, a continual model of thermoelastic system \"shell-ribs\" was taken. Singular differential equations of dynamical thermostability of geometrically irregular shallow shell had summands containing \"stretch-compression\" and \"shift\" of the ribs. Tangential forces caused by heating of the shell and transversal strain were recorded by \"piston theory\" in a standard way. Tangential forces were preliminarily defined on the basis of the solutions of singular differential equations of momentless thermoelasticity in displacements with inhomogeneous edge conditions and were contained in a Brian form. The solution of the system of dynamical equations of thermoelasticity of the shell was searched for in the form of the sum of the double trigonometric series with time coordinate variable coefficients for bending function and polynomials for the tangential components of the field of displacement. On the basis of Galerkin procedure the system of differential equations for the coefficients of approximated series was defined. Then it was reduced to one differential equation of the forth order. The solution was obtained in the second approximation, which corresponded to two half-waves along the flow and one half-wave in perpendicular direction. Critical values of relative flow rates were defined using standard techniques of the analysis of dynamical stability of geometrically irregular shallow shell. Quantitative results were presented in the tables showing the dependence of geometrical parameters of the elastic system and temperature on the values of critical rates.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"2","rating":"19.32"},

Failure of a system element refers to the removal of the corresponding vertex from the system graph along with all its edges. Later together with Frank Harary the model was extended to links failures. The formalization of a fault-tolerant system implementation is the extension of the graph. The graph G* is called the vertex k-extension of the graph G if after removing any k vertices from the graph G* result graph contains the graph G. A vertex k-extension of the graph G is called minimal if it has the least number of vertices and edges among all vertex k-extensions of the graph G.

According to the data, the vast majority of respondents did not encounter violations of national or religious rights, and among those who actually experienced national discrimination (personally or in close social circle) it was expressed in the form of ignoring, insulting, difficulties when looking for employment, threats and physical abuse. In general, the low prevalence of direct forms of negative ethnic-religious attitudes proves the high level of tolerance in the Saratov Region. Interethnic relations of the Saratovites with representatives of the Caucasian peoples are more prone to conflicts than with representatives of peoples traditionally settled in the region (Ukrainians, Tatars, Kazakhs, Jews, Bashkirs, Volga Germans). Despite the prevailing positive assessments of the national policy, it still needs to take into account the features of the Saratov Region.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"4","rating":"23.46"},

The aim of the article is a detection of structure of the set of acceptable outcomes in antagonistic games with ordered outcomes (all required definitions for antagonistic games with ordered outcomes indicated in the introduction, see section 1). In section 2 we offer some classification for outcomes in antagonistic games. Using this classification, a localization of acceptable outcomes is specified (see section 3). In section 4 certain sufficient conditions for non-emptiness and uniqueness of acceptable outcomes are found. Some examples related to localization of acceptable outcomes in antagonistic games with ordered outcomes are given.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"1","rating":"37.41"},

Frank and the Swiss psychiatrist L. Binswanger. It is one of the most notable examples of philosophical dialogue between Russia and Western Europe. It lasted for almost 16 years from November 1934 to December 1950. The correspondents make a very open and intimate conversation on various topics, e. g. elevated understanding of true male friendship, scientific interests in the fields of psychology, philosophy, religion, psychoanalysis, medicine, travels, conferences, presentations, meetings of philosophers, mutual friends, circle of reading (Russian literature and contemporary European authors), history of Europe, everyday life, everyday concerns about children and spouse, illness, notifications of the death of loved ones. The correspondence between Frank and Binswanger has a character of confession and helps not only clarify certain facts of the life of the Russian philosopher in emigration, but also provides new valuable materials for understanding his personal, spiritual and philosophical evolution, as well as the creative history of published and unpublished works. Currently, this correspondence, kept in the archive of the University of Tubingen, is being prepared for publication both in Russian translation and in the original languages (German, French, English).","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"2","rating":"17.13"},

The author systematizes the criteria of belonging to the gentry in historiography and applies them to the Armburgh family. The article shows that the Armburghs belonged to the lesser gentry according to the income level, the structure of their land holdings and methods of estate management. It was the land that was of the greatest value to them as a marker of social status and the main source of their income. The household of the Armburghs was focused on commodity production but they were connected with the town not only by their economic interests, but also by family relations. The author gives a number of arguments showing that the interests of the Armburghs were primarily concentrated in the counties in which their lands were located - Essex, Hertfordshire and Warwickshire. They were integrated into social life of their counties due to numerous family, matrimonial, neighborly and friendly relations that united the gentry. The gentry of the first half of the 15th century were involved in the power system of their counties, exercising their authority as landowners, and due to personal relations and service to their lords and the king. In the author's opinion, the material of the Armburgh Papers enables to state that social characteristics of the 15th-century-gentry meet the criteria developed developed in historiography.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"1","rating":"45.48"},

Material and Methods - The contemporary nonlinear methods developed for the analysis of complex non-periodic signals were applied to the study of electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals from women during minor gynecological operations. The registered signals were the single-channel ECG at the II standard lead and three channels of PPG (from earlobe, right ring finger, and right second toe). These signals were recorded under resting conditions at 60 minutes before the surgery and during the main stage of operation under the spinal anesthesia and ataractanalgesia. The signals were sampled at a frequency of 250 Hz and filtered in the 0.05-0.15 Hz band, which includes the rhythms of autonomic control of heart rate and vascular tone. Results - The analysis of phase dynamics of the studied oscillatory systems revealed that the spinal anesthesia suppresses the coupling between the rhythms of autonomic control of heart rate (extracted from ECG) and vascular tone (extracted from PPG) but in a less degree than general anesthesia induced by ataractanalgesia. The strength of the detected coupling between the heart rate variability and PPG depends on the distance between the body parts from which the ECG and PPG signals were recorded. The coupling was found out to be stronger for smaller distances. Conclusion - The obtained results may have not only diagnostic, but also prognostic importance for the estimation of circulatory failure during operations under surgical anesthesia.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"7","rating":"6.27"},

The coefficients of the differential expression are assumed to be constants.

The differential expression and the boundary forms are assumed to be homogeneous, that is, they contain only main parts. It is supposed that roots of the characteristic equation of the pencils of this class are simple, non-zero and lie on two rays emanating from the origin in quantities k and n - k. Sufficient conditions of m-fold system completeness of root functions of the pencils of this class in the space of square integrable functions on the main segment (with a possible finite defect) are formulated. The multiplicity m completeness depends on the relations of the parameters n, l and k. In this case, it is assumed that some completely concrete determinants differ from zero. These determinants are constructed from the coefficients of the boundary forms of the pencil and the roots of the characteristic equation.

An accidental combination of events is a set of defects in equipment, software and human errors, relatively non-dangerous separately but leading to an accident when they occur in a certain order at a certain time interval. Modern warning tools can parry mainly individual adverse effects and to effectively prevent critical modes it is necessary to provide mathematical analysis of systems for accidental combinations of events at different time intervals. The task of managing the prevention of accidental combinations of events is set as the task of the variational calculus on the conditional extremum. A method for solving the problem based on the analysis of failure trees and ways of successful operation is proposed. The given method allows selecting the minimum set of adverse events, the parrying of which makes it possible to reduce the likelihood of emergency combinations to a safe level. The properties of the paths of successful functioning were determined and proved including accurate estimates for their number which allows ranking tasks by time complexity and increasing the efficiency of their solution. Heuristic approaches were developed which allow to take into account the order of occurrence of events when managing the process of preventing their emergency combinations. The specified sequence of incidents are taken into account by allocating graphs and event aggregation. The obtained results are intended for use in decision support systems at various levels in managing the prevention of critical conditions and accidents of human-machine and organizational systems.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"1","rating":"38.64"},

It is important also to present classical and modern solution methods and to compare their efficiency. More details are concerned with optimization methods and the Pontryagin maximum principle, in particular. A value region is the set {f(z(0))} of all possible values for the functional f bar right arrow f(z(0)) where z(0) is a fixed point either in the upper half-plane for the chordal case or in the unit disk for the radial case, and f runs through a class of conformal mappings. Solutions to the Loewner differential equations form dense subclasses of function families under consideration. The coefficient value regions {(a(2),...,a(n)) : f(z) = z + Sigma(infinity)(n=2) a(n)z(n)}, vertical bar z vertical bar < 1, are the part of the field closely linked with extremal problems and the Bombieri conjecture about the structure of the coefficient region for the class S in a neighborhood of the point (2,...,n) corresponding to the Koebe function.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"1","rating":"38.64"},

However, literature data on the values of these parameters vary significantly. The objective of this study is to identify image-based morphological parameter values which correlate with cerebral aneurysm rupture and can be used during preoperative planning to detect aneurysms prone to rupture. Mean values of the morphological factors such as aspect ratio and size ratio were chosen from the literature. These factors were sampled for ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. Statistical analysis of these factors was performed. Statistically significant differences were obtained between mean values in samples of size ratio and aspect ratio for ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. There were no statistically confirmed differences between size ratios for ruptured and unruptured anterior communicating artery aneurysms. In contrast, such differences were revealed for both of examined parameters for posterior communicating artery and middle cerebral artery. ROC analysis revealed critical values of aspect ratio and size ratio which distinguish ruptured aneurysms from unruptured ones. High correlation was obtained between size ratio and aspect ratio. Mean values of aspect ratio and size ratio published in recent articles are smaller than the values published 10-15 years ago. Diagram size ratio - aspect ratio showed threshold value of aspect ratio. It was shown that among considered morphological factors, aspect ratio was meaningful. Moreover, aspect ratio correlates with size ratio, and therefore we assume that size ratio is redundant. The obtained criterion value of AR = 1. 2 in our opinion is logical. It was also confirmed by ROC analysis.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"3","rating":"12.88"},

The geometric nonlinearity is taken into account by the model of Theodor von Karman. We consider a nonclassical continuum shell model based on the Cosserat medium with constrained particle rotation (pseudocontinuum). It is assumed that the displacement and rotation fields are not independent. An additional independent material length parameter associated with the symmetric tensor of the rotation gradient is introduced into consideration. The equations of motion of the shell element, boundary and initial conditions are obtained from the variational principle of Ostrogradskii - Hamilton on the basis of kinematic hypotheses of the third approximation (Peleha - Sheremetyev - Reddy), allowing to take into account not only the rotation, but also the curvature of the normal after deformation. It is assumed that the cylindrical shell consists of n families of edges, each of which is characterized by an inclination angle with respect to the positive direction of the axis directed along the length of the shell and the distance between neighboring edges. The shell material is isotropic, elastic, and obeys Hooke's law. A dissipative mechanical system is considered. As a special case, the system of equations of motion for Kirchhoff - Love's micro-polar reticulated shell is presented. The theory constructed in this paper can be used, among other things, for studying the behavior of CNTs under the action of static and dynamic loads.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"4","rating":"9.66"},
{"id":"283","title":"Classification and Recognition of Structures of Genetic Sequences","journal_id":"260","description":"For solving problems of determining the relationships between the properties of organisms and the properties of the corresponding genetic sequences, we proposed a classification of genetic sequences based on numerical indicators of recurrent and Z-recurrent shapes, which define the structure of functional relationships of elements in sequences. For numerical indicators of recurrent and Z-recurrent shapes, we introduce a method of classification of genetic sequences. We compared a numerical characteristic that generalizes numerical values with a numerical characteristic of recurrent or Z-recurrent shapes which determine the structure of a sequence for each sequence of a biological rank considered in the recognition problem, which has a meaningful interpretation in the application area. The problem of recognition is considered from two points of view: when we determine belonging of a sequence to a specific rank of sequences, and when we determine which group of sequences contains the experimental sequence. Basic mathematical difficulties in solving these recognition problems are associated with the search difference in numerical representation of recurrent and Z-recurrent shapes of experimental sequences. To overcome these difficulties we created a spectrum of numerical indicators of recurrent and Z-recurrent shapes. Classification and recognition of sequences are illustrated by an example with three ranks of genetic codes of organisms, each of them represented by 5 sequences. Z-recurrent shape is introduced to define and extend the classification of sequences and increase the efficiency of recognition methods.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"2","rating":"19.32"},

The approach yields images that superficially resemble traditional laser speckle contrast images, but instead of relying on the statistics of the local time integrated intensity values calculated over temporal and sliding spatial windows as is done in LSCI to create images, ellipticity imaging (EI) directly yields images that quantify the relative dominance of long-range correlations in the temporal dimension of a series of speckle patterns to the short-range correlations in the same dimension. The approach relies on a Poincare analysis of the speckle data which yields metrics that statistically describe both the short-terms variations in the temporal speckle intensity (i.e., the standard deviation in successive differences) and also the corresponding long term variations. These metrics are plotted against each other (Poincare plots) and an ellipse fit to the data. The ratio of the semi-major axis to the semi-minor axis of this ellipse for each temporal speckle sequence is then used as the data to form the images (thus the term EI). The results of flow phantom and mouse EI studies will be presented. Various flow rates of dilute intralipid were illuminated with a coherent laser source and EI images were generated.

The essence of the theoretical conceptualization of the \"intelligent power\" is that it is based mainly on internal resources and allows to focus on developing the national worldview platform consolidating basic meanings of social system and goals of its development. The possibilities of sociology as a resource of \"intelligent power\" are in its expert, scientific-educational, innovative and discursive potential.

Special PPS designed for vertebral-pelvic complex surgery allow evaluate bone and joint deformation degree, planning simultaneous implants replacement, osteotomy. The evaluation is based on 2D and 3D medical images ( if available) studying. The analysis of the most demanded modern PPS ( MediCad, TraumaCad, OrthoView and Surgimap) properties shows that all of these products allow to measure a massive number of orthopedic parameters: scoliosis, lordosis, sagittal balance, the angular deviation of the sacrum, the cervico-diaphyseal angle, the Hilgenreiner angle etc. However not all of indicated systems allow to automatically search such parameters as the Reimer index ( percentage) and epiphyseal index. Also not all the systems have the detection of calibration devices function and Auto-Hip function. So the aim of this study is to identify and prove the sufficient number of parameters to be evaluated by the surgeon to perform correct geometric preoperative planning in vertebral and pelvic complex surgery.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"8","rating":"4.74"},

According to the dividend signaling hypothesis, dividends, being an indicator of profitability and financial stability, act as determinants of a company's sustainable development. This affects its stock price and forges corporate reputation for investors. The authors examine the dynamics of dividends paid out by the leading Russian companies highlighting the phases of emergence and formation of dividend policy in Russia, industry-specific nature and the dominant type of dividend policy. The authors apply the classification of the types of dividend policy (conservative, moderate and aggressive) and use the methods of analysis and synthesis, econometric modeling (regression model building). The source data include the ratings and statistical evidence provided by the Russian Institute of Directors (RID) as well as statistical data retrieved from online resources. The authors conclude that, since 2001, Russian companies have been paying dividends to win investment attractiveness in the eyes of foreign investors. We suppose, therefore, that the emerging dividend policy is becoming one of the indicators of corporate reputation of Russian companies. The analysis shows no statistically significant dependence of stock prices of Russian companies on the size of dividends paid out, but there is some evidence that dividend signaling hypothesis is being implemented in the Russian economy. The study reveals that aggressive dividend policy prevailing in companies partly owned by the state is due to the specificity of rules and regulations in Russia and ambitions of other companies to improve their reputation among investors.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"3","rating":"17.78"},

Particles were characterized by TEM, UV-VIS and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). We found that the extinction spectra of monodisperse Au nanospheres are equal to those calculated by using Mie theory (both in the position and width of the plasmonic band). The deviation of shape from a sphere that is typical of citrate-stabilized nanoparticles leads to a significant departure of the optical properties from those predicted by Mie theory. The non-sphericity of these particles also affects the measurement of their size by DLS. In particular, citrate-stabilized nanoparticles display a bimodal size distribution associated to rotational diffusion.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"4","rating":"11.04"},

{"id":"338","title":"Development of an original technology for manufacturing of RF antennas on flexible substrates","journal_id":"326","description":"We have propose an original approach for fabrication of flexible antennas for biomedical-related applications. The technology is based on magnetron sputtering and laser ablation methods. The magnetron sputtering method is used to deposit a thin layer of metal (copper) on a flexible substrate (polyimide film). Then laser ablation is utilized to remove excess copper thus forming an antenna pattern on the metal layer. ISM band flexible design with microstrip feeding structure was chosen for testing this technique. Results of numerical simulation are presented. A number of test flexible antennas were fabricated by our original approach. Similar flexible antennas were also fabricated via photolithography process. A comparison of the experimental results of return loss (S11) measurements of antennas with different fabrication approach was carried out. The obtained experimental data is in a good agreement with the numerical modeling results. Proposed technology has significant advantages in cost, speed, and flexibility over photolithography processes commonly utilized for such applications.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"8","rating":"5.74"},

The microstrip meander-line SWS is suitable for using in a millimeter-band TWT amplifiers. Several samples of copper microstrip meander-line SWS on a quartz substrate consisting of 50 meander periods with input and output couplers were designed, microfabricated and optimized The SWS was microfabricated by using magnetron sputtering and laser ablation processes. This technique is a more facile, flexible and lower cost as compared to photolithography method. Transmission and reflection of proposed SWS were measured experimentally and calculated numerically. The results of the experimental cold-test measurements are verified by numerical simulations.

This work is dedicated to application of molecularly imprinted silica gel (MISG) as a CRN-selective sorbent for solid phase extraction to improve SERS based detection of CRN in urine. MISG was prepared using sol-gel process in the presence of a template (CRN) and aluminum ions which served as a doping agent to create recognition sites. Spectrophotometry studies showed that the combination of doping and imprinting improves sorption capacity 3 times. We found that doping plays a key role and imprinting without doping does not lead to sorption improvement at all. Hydroxylamine stabilized silver nanoparticles were used as SERS substrate and the maximal CRN signal (i.e., analysis sensitivity) was found in alkaline media. Also, addition of alkali leads to dissolution of MISG matrix that was used to release CRN molecules and speed-up of analysis by skipping elution step. SERS results also demonstrate that MISG possesses the maximal sorption in comparison with silica gels fabricated without imprinting and\/or doping. Therefore, the final analysis protocol implies solid phase extraction of CRN from a solution with further pH adjusting of the MISG-CRN complex and SERS detection of the released CRN. The protocol testing using model CRN solution and a urine sample demonstrated possibility for CRN detection at physiologically relevant concentrations and significant reduction of SERS background after extraction step.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"3","rating":"19.92"},

The rats (8 animals) were divided into 2 experimental groups. The first (hypoxia) group was subjected to hypoxia throughout pregnancy (21 days). The second (control) group was not exposed to any effect throughout the pregnancy. On the 20th day of gestation in both groups, a Doppler ultrasound study of uterine-fetal blood flow and measurement of the placenta was performed. Newborn rat pups of the first day of life were subjected to oxygenation degree measurement. After delivery, the number of rats in the litter was counted and their body weight was measured. After the measurements the laboratory animals were withdrawn from the experiments and morphological study of their internal organs was performed. The studies have shown a clear relationship between the characteristics of uterine blood flow and the presence or absence of hypoxia. In chronic hypoxia, there were low rates of arterial blood flow, an increase in the peripheral resistance of uterine vessels. All this indicates the defective formation of the placenta and impaired blood flow with the development of placental insufficiency. It was also found that hypoxia in the antenatal period adversely affects the number and somatometric indicators of newborn rats in the offspring. Histological examination of the tissues of the heart, liver and kidney of newborn rat pups showed signs of impaired blood circulation, dystrophic and necrobiotic changes in the parenchyma.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"6","rating":"9.96"},

Found that the process of concentration of nanoparticles, functionalized with human immune globulins IgA and IgG, around the cells of microorganisms with the formation of \"clouds\" leads to the appearance of a microscale zone of elevated temperature. This ensures a synergistic effect of a multiplicative increase in the volume of the hyperthermia zone.

The social activity of young people is the driving force behind socio-economic and socio-political processes in society. It is due to their social activity that positive changes are taking place in different spheres of life. Objective. We set out to analyze the preferences and predictors of the directions of young people's social activity. Design. Our study involved 251 people from the Saratov region, Russia, of median age (M) 20.11, SD = 1.2 (41% male). To measure their basic assumptions, we used the Janoff-Bulmann World Assumptions Scale (WAS); their identity characteristics were measured with the Kuhn and McPartland Twenty Statements Test (TST) \"Who am I?\". To evaluate their social behavior preferences, we used 11 unique proprietary scales which we developed on the basis of a pilot study with relevant theoretical validity. Results. Our study found that youth preferences for various forms of social activity can be divided into two main clusters: organizational-social and individual-personal. Our results revealed that individual-personal activity had a more complex structure, with well-expressed intensity, than the organizational-social form of social activity Young people's assumptions most strongly condition variations in their preferences for educational-developmental, socio-political, recreational-cognitive, and self-development-related spheres of activity. The most influential predictors of social activity in young people are their assumptions regarding their own significance, their ability to manage events, and their luckiness. We established that an individual's basic beliefs do not influence variations in their preferences for mass cultural, religious, creative, and informal activities in a group. Young people's sense of identity influences variations in their preferred types of social activity. The most influential predictors of social activity preferences were negative personal, personal, and family-related identities. Preferences for social activity are less influenced by gender, religious, and ethnic identity, as well as by identity based on activity and appearance. Conclusion. We present some conclusions regarding the strong determination of the first cluster (political, religious and voluntary types of activity) by identity, and the second cluster (ranging from educational to recreational cognitive activity) by assumptions about the world.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"3","rating":"14.42"},

Studies were conducted in the Khvalynsky National Park (forest-steppe zone of Russia) in 2008-2018. The authors conducted a complex study in burned and unburned plant communities. An assessment of the effects of fire impact and the development of a post-fire action plan were considered in the Protected Area. The plant community Paeonia tenuifolia + Calamagrostis epigejos + Adonis vernalis - Potentilla volgarica burned down in 2009. The plant community Paeonia tenuifolia + Stipa pennata + Adonis vernalis - Anemone sylvestris was unburned. To characterise plant communities with Paeonia tenuifolia and its coenopopulations, we used standard geobotanical description methods. Sixty seven vascular plant species were part of the post-fire phytocoenosis. Of them, 14 species are included in the Red Data Book of the Saratov region. Changes in the post-fire plant community have occurred in the following order: 1) Paeonia tenuifolia + Calamagrostis epigejos + Adonis vernalis - Stipa pennata (in 2008) -> 2) Paeonia tenuifolia + Elymus repens + Stipa pennata + Adonis vernalis + Thalictrum simplex (in 2010) -> 3) Paeonia tenuifolia - Stipa pennata - Calamagrostis epigejos + Festuca valesiaca + Phleum pratense + Poa bulbosa + Prunus tenella (in 2011) -> 4) Paeonia tenuifolia + Adonis vernalis + Stipa pennata (in 2015, 2017, 2018). After the fire influence on a plant community, the following changes took place: 1) annuals and ruderal plant species appeared and increased their abundance; 2) the ratio of dominant species has changed. In 2012-2018, the phytocenotic role of Calamagrostis epigejos decreased, while the coverage and abundance of Stipa pennata increased at the same period. The abundance dynamics of Paeonia tenuifolia decreased in 2010, while in 2015-2018, its value gradually increased. The species richness of the post-pyrogenic plant community varied from 20 species in the first post-fire year to 38 species in the last study year. In the first post-fire year, the families Poaceae (six species), Leguminosae plants (three species), Rosaceae plants (three species) occupied the leading positions. During the post-pyrogenic succession, the dominant position of the listed families was not changing. Species of Compositae, Poaceae, Ranunculaceae families prevailed in the unburned plant community. Steppe plants dominated in the post-fire plant community: Stipa pennata, Adonis vernalis, and Paeonia tenuifolia. The leading ecologic-coenotic groups were steppe plants (70%), meadow plants (16%), forest plants (5%), and ruderal plants (9%). Weed-steppe plants were indicators of habitat disturbance by human activities. Among weed-steppe plants, there were Arenaria serpyllifolia, Viola rupestris, Erysimum canescens, Verbascum lychnitis. Gradient analysis of environmental conditions showed that the highest value of the vitality index (IVC = 1.15) corresponds to the best conditions for the growth and survival of the Paeonia tenuifolia population in the post-fire community. In the control site, the vitality index (IVC = 0.85) corresponded to unfavourable conditions for plant development. We studied the age spectra of the natural Paeonia tenuifolia populations in the burned and unburned communities. We showed that both populations were normal, complete, and young. The fire-damaged populations were younger than the populations in the unburned communities. We suggest the need of comprehensive monitoring studies to properly assess the fire effects and subsequent management actions for the vegetation restoration after fire influence.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"3","rating":"15.41"},

The conclusion is drawn that the process of production of the past ceases to be linearly directed, turning into a network interaction of different actors, which includes not only the state as the main \"customer\" of the images of the past, but also economic entities, as well as consumers who actively participate in modification of the produced product. The authors note that the essential factor is the totality of commercialization, combined with the formation of individual and local segments of symbolic production and consumption of the past.

Although this modality has proven beneficial, especially for less experienced physicians, the full capacity of the autofluorescence spectroscopy as diagnostic modality for cancer detection is yet to be established. This requires better understanding of the diagnostic value of the observed spectral properties differing cancerous and healthy gastrointestinal tissues, also defining highly specific optical markers based on these spectral peculiarities This work presents an investigation of fluorescence characteristics of ex vivo gastrointestinal tissue samples of cancerous and healthy tissue, through excitation-emission matrices (EEMs). This method allows detection of fluorescence pattern in a broad spectrum range along with evaluating the correlation of diagnostically valuable fluorophores' fluorescence maxima and the respective excitation wavelengths. The main tissue fluorophores, contributing for the observed EEMs, are tyrosine, tryptophan, NADH, FAD, collagen and elastin.Since the EEMs produce a lot of data, principal component analysis was used to reduce them to the most meaningful spectral features in respect to excitation and emission wavelengths.

This approach uses the different manner in which healthy tissues depolarize light, compared to the tumor ones. In extremely scattering optical media, such as biological tissues, light undergoes multiples scattering events, leading to changes in the two orthogonal components of the electric field E-x, E-y and a phase shift between them, which partially or fully depolarizes the initial polarization. When the size of the scattering particles is less than the wavelength of light (d < lambda), then the linear polarization is preserved better. On the contrary, when the size of the scattering particles is greater than the wavelength of light (d > lambda), then the circular polarization is preserved better. Measuring the Stokes parameters of light with linear and circular polarization and wavelength lambda = 635 nm, diagnostic conclusions might be obtained for the histological condition of the samples, which are in agreement with the analysis of the pathologists. Moreover, this approach optimizes the differentiation based on polarization properties for the investigated soft tissues samples.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"5","rating":"9.82"},

The purpose of the article is a theoretical and empirical analysis of the job insecurity due its influence on the employee job attitudes. Design. The design of the study was longitudinal. The empirical results were collected in 2017-2018. The empirical basis of the research is the separate structural department of the hank. The organization has realized downsizing project during the collection of empirical data. It has made possible to analyze the job satisfaction and work engagement before, during and after the downsizing project. Sample size N = 151 (at the start), and N = 116 (at the end) of the study. The measures used in the present study are: 1) the \"Utrecht Work Engagement Scale\" (Schaufeli, Bakker, 2003); 2) \"Brief Job Satisfaction Measure\" (Judge, Locke, Durham, Kluger, 1998); 3) \"The Job Insecurity Scale\" by De Witte (2000; 2012). Scales 2-3 administered by A. Smirnova. Findings. An empirical analysis of the dynamics of job attitudes in the groups differ in age and gender has found out a short-term motivating effect of the threat of job loss. The motivating effect of the threat of job loss is lost during six months. The most significance motivating effect was wound out in within the group of ordinary employees in the senior category over 45 years. The threat of dismissal also has the greatest impact on the behavior change of that part of the staff that is most susceptible to experiencing job insecurity (regardless of age). The employees who perceived the job insecurity are more satisfied with their work and value it more highly. However, as the duration of the threats of the working situation increases, job attitudes show negative trends. Long-term experiencing of the job insecurity leads to the change the job attitude (to the worse) and reduces the labor input. Limitations. The study presented here is not without limitations. First and foremost, we did not pay sufficient attention to the family status of the employee and its role in the perception of job insecurity and job attitudes change. Despite on it, the findings presented in articles has its theoretical meaning in clarifying of the job insecurity experiencing and its psychological consequence and usefulness in organizational change project.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"1","rating":"39.72"},

The author provides linguo-communicative (speech genre), linguocultural, linguo-cognitive (value), and linguo-statistical (corpus) analysis of the genre, which is regarded as a genre of communication and speech with no equivalents in other cultures, a scenario and value of Russian speech communication and Russian culture as a whole. Analysis of the genre reveals its significant complexity and inconsistency, including value inconsistency: heart-to-heart talk can be \"simple\" - and beyond someone's capacity to understand; with an \"simple\" interlocutor - and a highly educated specialist; with \"one's own\" - and with a stranger; it can be short - and long; relaxed, \"light\" - and tense, \"hard\"; it can be pleasant, \"partial\", and include elements of flattery - and harsh criticism; it can lead to reconciliation - and to a quarrel; it can be calm - and include elements of a dispute (razgovor po dusham between men) or hysterics (between women); usually a heart-to-heart talk cannot take place \"on demand\". Razgovor po dusham is regarded positively when conducted (successfully) by psychologists with mentally ill or unstable people. In the majority of cases, the evaluative characteristics of the razgovor po dusham reflected in the examples are positive and highly positive; at the same time, there are negative characteristics. The article takes into account studies of cultural concepts in the Russian national and linguistic worldview ( truth, friendship, sincerity, \"Toka\" longing, etc.) and complements the picture with a number of important concepts, associated with the communicative-pragmatic and genrerole nature of the phenomenon, and with the peculiarities of paradigmatics and syntagmatics in the contexts of modern Russian speech.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"1","rating":"34.62"},

The example of the American legal model established that the initial inclusion of privacy in the legal field was a means of protecting the individual against possible invasion of privacy. In the context of the analysis of modern understanding of privacy, it is proved that the improvement of digital technologies and digitization of personal data together with the possibility of their automatic collection and processing leads to notions of privacy as an analogue to intellectual property of the individual. Personal data is increasingly becoming a commodity for client-oriented companies. At the same time, Western society still tends to understand the elites' privacy as human rights and dignity. The analysis of the development prospects of the digital society gives reason to believe that in the near future it is possible to expect appreciable influence of transformation of artificial intellect systems on understanding of privacy.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"2","rating":"25.39"},

A complete resection of tumor is the most important factor, determining an efficiency of its treatment, while an incomplete resection, caused by inaccurate detection of tumor margins, increases a probability of the tumor recurrence. The existing methods of the intraoperative neurodiagnosis of tumors are plagued with limited sensitivity and specificity; they remain laborious, time-consuming and\/or rather expensive. Therefore, the development of novel methods for the intraoperative diagnosis of gliomas relying on modern instruments of medical imaging is a topical problem of medicine, physics, and engineering. In our research, we studied the ability of dual-modality imaging that combines such methods as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and terahertz (THz) pulsed spectroscopy, for intraoperative diagnosis of brain tumors with a strong emphasize on a human brain gliomas. We performed experimental studies of the frequency-dependent THz dielectric properties and OCT imaging of healthy (intact) and pathological brain tissues ex vivo in order to analyze the prospect for differentiation between tissue classes.

However, Omnipaque(TM) 300 causes considerably less skin dehydration than glycerol. In addition, the results of examination of the OC effect on autofluorescence in two-photon excitation and background fluorescence in Raman scattering at different skin depths are presented. It is shown that Omnipaque(TM) 300 is a promising OCA due to its ability to reduce background fluo-rescence in the upper skin layers.

Convex regression is the extension of monotone regression to the case of 2-monotonicity (or convexity). Both isotone and convex regression have applications in many fields, including the non-parametric mathematical statistics and the empirical data smoothing. The paper proposes an iterative algorithm for constructing a sparse convex regression, i.e. for finding a convex vector z is an element of R-n with the lowest square error of approximation to a given vector y is an element of R-n (not necessarily convex). The problem can be rewritten in the form of a convex programming problem with linear constraints.

This approach gives an algorithm for construction of band-limited orthogonal scaling functions with compact support in a concrete fashion using some class of directed graphs, which, in turn, is obtained from the so-called N-valid trees introduced by the same authors in 2012. Up to this point, though, it was not known whether this algorithm is good enough to produce any possible orthogonal scaling function of such a class.

{"id":"434","title":"Multispectral Autofluorescence Detection of Skin Neoplasia Using Steady-state Techniques","journal_id":"432","description":"In the current study were used excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) steady-state techniques in a broad spectral regions (excitation at 220-500 nm and emission at 280-850 nm) to achieve the whole set of endogenous fluorophores, existed in normal and neoplastic cutaneous tissues. Several types of benign, dysplastic and malignant types of skin lesions were investigated ex vivo using both EEM and SFS modalities, namely the basal cell papilloma and carcinoma, pigmented nevi, dysplastic nevi, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Histological analysis was used as a \"gold standard\" for evaluation of clinical diagnosis of the lesions investigated. Comparison with the normal skin tissue spectral data was made, based on the signals detected from the safety margins areas of the surgically excised tumours. EEM and SFS data reveal statistically significant differences between variety of benign, dysplastic and malignant lesions, which could be used as fingerprints, applicable for differentiation algorithms. In a few of malignancies endogenous porphyrins signals were even observed, but in general the fluorescence signals were addressed to the coenzymes, such as NADH, flavins; structural proteins, such as collagen, elastin and their cross-links, as well as keratin in the case of basal cell lesions. Pigments, such as hemoglobin and melanin distorted the signal due to intrinsic fluorophores signal reabsorption, what has to be taken into account when the algorithms for discrimination of the pathology types are developed.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"11","rating":"3.31"},
{"id":"435","title":"The family business of the Eastlake spouses","journal_id":"435","description":"The article deals with the life and work of the Eastlake spouses who purchased the paintings of the Italian Quattrocento for the National Gallery of London in the 1850s-60s. Charles Eastlake was a famous artist and the first director of the National Gallery of London. Elizabeth Rigby was a journalist and art critic Thanks to their efforts, the Gallery had not only been enriched by masterpieces of art, it also provided an opportunity to recreate a rather consistent history of the development of Renaissance art in Italy. This example shows the desire to explain scientifically and systematize phenomena and to see progress in everything, which was typical of the middle 19th century. The Eastlake spouses' collecting activities, as well as the works of Pre-Raphaelite artists, developed public interest in Quattrocento art.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"1","rating":"33.33"},

{"id":"437","title":"Measuring optical properties of human liver between 400 and 1000 nm","journal_id":"285","description":"Laser diagnostics and treatment procedures are commonly performed for visible and near-IR wavelengths. The knowledge of the wavelength dependences for the optical properties of various biological tissues in this spectral range is useful for clinical applications. Since the optical properties of human liver have been previously known only for near-IR wavelengths, the aim is to estimate their wavelength dependences between 400 and 1000 nm. Using spectral measurements from liver samples in this range, we determine their optical properties with the inverse adding-doubling method. The obtained results indicate the presence of bile, oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin in human liver. The combination of these biological components results in strong absorption for wavelengths between 400 and 600 nm, with peaks at unusual wavelengths. For wavelengths above 600 nm, the wavelength dependences for all optical properties present the typical behavior, but strong and shifted absorption observed for wavelengths below 600 nm has been previously unknown and can be useful for clinical procedures with lasers working in this range.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"5","rating":"13.84"},

It is shown that if nanoparticle temperature is determined from the photoluminescence spectra, an error arises related to spectrum distortion due to light scattering in a sample. A correction algorithm for reducing this error is developed.","publication_date":null,"co-authors_number":"5","rating":"13.84"},

The sub-ns time step of the dynamical images allowed us to observe the absence of incubation times for the motion of the domain wall within an uncertainty of 200 ps, together with indications for a negligible inertia of the domain wall. Furthermore, we observed that, for short current and magnetic field pulses, the magnetic domain walls do not exhibit a tilting during their motion, providing a mechanism for the fast, tilt-free, current-induced motion of magnetic domain walls.","publication_date":"JAN","co-authors_number":"8","rating":"50.04"},

{"id":"441","title":"The Photobiomodulation of Vital Parameters of the Cancer Cell Culture by Low Dose of Near-IR Laser Irradiation","journal_id":"440","description":"The mechanisms underlining the cell adaptive and\/or activating oxidative stress, called low level light or photobiomodulation therapies (PBMT), still remain unclear for the near-infrared spectrum range (750-3000 nm), especially for the 1265-1270 nm range (highest absorption by molecular oxygen). It is most probable that the mitochondria may also appear to be the main target for these wavelengths. It is known that mitochondria can generate ROS under visible and 800-1060 nm spectrum range irradiation, which in turn control voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC). Here we investigated cellular damage regarding VDAC activity, level of oxidative stress, malondialdehyde content, cell viability, mitochondrial potential and mass, GSH level, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA damage in the cancer cell culture exposed to low-level laser irradiation at 1265 nm. We used a continuous wave laser with output power 4 mW; the energy densities employed were 0.39.45 J\/cm(2). We observed that the laser radiation at 1265 nm can induce the oxidative stress, enhance apoptosis, and disturb mitochondrial functioning at the energy density of 9.54 J\/cm(2). In addition, inhibition of VDAC enhances the observed effects. It has been shown that the laser irradiation at 1265 nm damages mitochondrial DNA but does not affect the nuclear DNA. The performed experiments bring us to the conclusion that the laser irradiation at 1265 nm can affect cells through mitochondrial damage and the inhibition of VDAC enhances effects of PBMT.","publication_date":"JAN-FEB","co-authors_number":"10","rating":"14.42"},

As a corollary we get for n >= m an isomorphism Lambda(+y)(m,n) = Lambda(+y)(m,m) circle times Lambda(+y)(0,n-m). It is also true for polynomial rings, but in this case the isomorphism does not preserve the grading. For each type of rings some natural basis consisting of Euler supercharacters is constructed.

{"id":"443","title":"Effects of missing data on characterization of complex dynamics from time series","journal_id":"124","description":"Experimental time series often contain bad segments that arise from artifacts, changes in experimental conditions, or failures in recording equipment. Such segments are usually removed from the time series during the preprocessing stage that can alter the correlation or other properties of the signals. Aiming to reveal how the effects of data loss depend on the amount of missing data, we consider here different regimes of regular and chaotic dynamics with excluded segments. Using several data processing techniques, namely, the wavelet-transform modulus maxima (WTMM) approach, the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and the multiresolution analysis based on the discrete wavelet-transform (DWT), we demonstrate essentially different effects of the missing data for positively correlated time series and anti-correlated signals. All the techniques show that positively correlated time series are significantly less sensitive to excluded segments and enable the characterization of the object's properties even under the condition of an extreme data loss. We verify the ability of characterizing physiological systems using an example of the cerebrovascular dynamics based on time series with missing data. A weak sensitivity of the cerebral blood flow to data loss is an important issue for diagnostic-related studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

{"id":"444","title":"Kinetics of Rat Skin Optical Clearing at Topical Application of 40%Glucose: Ex Vivo and In Vivo Studies","journal_id":"440","description":"Optical, molecule diffusion, and mechanical properties of skin and blood microcirculation in the underlying tissues at topical application of 40%-glucose solution in rats were investigated. Optical clearing of ex vivo and in vivo skin was measured within the wavelength range of 400-900 nm using standard spectrometer, and blood microcirculation alterations was measured with laser speckle contrast imaging. Increase of skin collimated transmittance, transverse, and along skin shrinkage and weight loss was observed for the first 20-60 min of immersion, for the longer time, tissue swelling was found. The glucose diffusion coefficients in ex vivo and in vivo rat skin were evaluated as (1.11 +\/- 0.78) x 10(-6) and (1.54 +\/- 0.28) x 10(-6) cm(2)\/s, respectively. The decrease of average rate of microcirculation in 2.2 fold was observed. The results received allow one to evaluate glucose impact on skin tissue optical and mechanical properties and blood microcirculation.","publication_date":"JAN-FEB","co-authors_number":"5","rating":"28.84"}
